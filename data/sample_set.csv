"18a52232f822dbac","""Can you please try to see the glass being half full instead of half empty.  I'm certainly not trying to do anything that you or others would see as """"problematic"""".  Five weeks ago I was getting involved in wikipedia and I was feeling enthusiastic, so I posted something to some user groups (reaching 10,000+ members), encouraging them to contribute to wikipedia.  I thought, at the time, that long-time wikipedia people would be more welcoming of new people, and that wikipedians would be happy that I encouraged others to participate.  I was not trying to target and encourage employees of a commercial product to contribute.  The groups I posted to were user groups, not employee groups.  But yes, I guess that some employees belong to these groups as well.  And my comment about Hill using the talk page was simply to comment that my personal POV is that he found a good way for someone with COI to contribute. I feel that the negative and accusing tone of your last sentence is unwarranted. It is un-welcoming comments like that that drive away new wikipedia contributors.  I see my wikipedia contributions as a way of giving unselfishly to the world, trying to spread knowledge and improve understanding.  I think that even if I only have time to make a small number of contributions, I feel I am helping, and that this should be the spirit of wikipedia.  So seeing your criticism that I am not making enough edits to non-commercial products is just frustrating and disheartening to me.I hate feeling that I have to defend my reputation here, and I don't agree with you that editing non-commercial pages should improve anyone's appearance of trustworthiness.  However, your claim that I am only editing the wikipedia entries of """"these commercial products"""" is also just incorrect.  I don't know if there is a way to view the wikipedia contributions of others, but if there is, you would see that I've been making edits to many non-commercial pages, including CRISP-DM, Data mining, the journal Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, Predictive analytics, Statistics, Customer retention, Predictive Model Markup Language, Anomaly detection, SEMMA, Machine learning, Jacques Cousteau, SIGKDD, Decision tree learning.  Sometimes I'm making simple formatting edits, and sometimes I'm spending hours trying to track down the right references to put on the CRISP-DM page.  Yes, my edits are mostly in the general area of data mining, because that is where I have the greatest interest and knowledge.  Similarly, when I guest lecture at local universities, I lecture to these types of classes, not due to any collusion, but because that's what I know.Thanks for listening to my mini-rant.  I know I'm taking this more personally than you probably meant it.  But it bothers me when someone questions that I am not working hard enough or they question my ethics, and that's what your comments feel like.  All I'm asking is that long-established wikipedia people be more welcoming and encouraging, and give new people the benefit of the doubt that they are acting in good faith trying to make meaningful contributions (however small).  New people grow and adjust - but it takes a while to learn the conventions of the wikipedia community.  Please be patient and encouraging to new people.I'm going to leave this discussion now.  If needed, I will return to it after the holiday season.  But I hope there is no need to.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

"cf7ab8e72c1070f1","Firstly, Montanabw, there is no such thing as Equus caballus. That is a domesticated animal. The proper name is Equus ferus caballus - unless domesticated Horses somehow come from Zebras or Asses... Also, there is no consensus that Equus ferus ever set foot on the North American continent, though I personally believe Equus lambei may be a subspecy of Equus ferus. Thirdly, and most importantly, and I hope EVERYONE is listening here when I say this, Equus ferus caballus, the domesticated Horse IS NO MORE native to the North American west than Chihuahuas are to the Canadian tundra. Domestic forms are native NOWHERE. Period. The domestic Horse is RADICALLY different from it's wild ancestor. And Dysmorodrepanis, the reason all the Equine articles are so Horse-centric is because a very large number of vociferous (and outright foolish) people are unhealthily obsessed with horses. Unfortunately, many of these people also think themselves expert enough to declare a domestic animal native to a continent it never inhabited simply because they like to watch them run. Seriously, that's all it is. They like looking at them. It's certainly not an environmental issue. Horses are wildly destructive to their surroundings. They eat more than cattle! And an obscene amount more than the native Pronghorn (which, by the way doesn't trample its food to death like the Mustangs do with they're enormous, heavy-stepping hooves). The only argument the Mustang and Burro worshippers have to use (and they milk it good, let me tell ya) is the similarity of Equus lambei to Equus ferus. But, Equus lambei has not been proven to be synonymous with Equus ferus (though it is a possibility), and even if it were it would be more closely related, by far, to Przewalski's Horse than to Mustangs! E. lambei was tiny! It was like four feet tall at the shoulders! And all the other North American Equids are pretty well-known to not be synonyms with Equus ferus (including E. caballus). Not by a long shot. This is why the Horse Evolution page (and every other page dealing with equines) has been changed back and forth so many times. The people who know what the heck they're talking about try to add useful information and correct blatant lies or grievous mistakes and the people who like pretty ponies go back and try to convince the world that Spanish horses have roamed every continent including Antarctica, Mars and the Sun since before Dinosaurs walked on two feet. I made the ridiculous mistake of trying to add factual information to the Mustang article and, if I remember correctly, it was changed WITHIN THE HOUR. The person doing the changing even removed the scientific names I inserted! The Mustang article has absolutely no indication of what specy the Mustang belongs to now! I swear this endless struggle between the My Little Ponyites and REAL BIOLOGISTS is like the Evolution vs. creationism argument, only dumber. Like I said, these people aren't calling for us to turn our rotweillers loose into the nearest forest, but why not? I mean, it's the same specy as the Gray Wolf. Domestication doesn't matter, if you listen to these people. If that's the case then why aren't we restocking mature Oak forests with farm raised white turkeys? I mean, it's the same specy, after all. Oh. And this is my favourite. Where Wild Asses are actually native they're critically endangered. But I have not read ONE WORD from the Cult of the Mustang and Burro about saving them from ACTUAL extinction, but get this, they want to have the Mustangs and Burros in America declared endangered species.

In fact, if this difficult constitutional question had to be addressed, FISA would be unconstitutional as applied to this narrow context.

The first paragraph includes useful and clear overview of the topic, however, it could use a little more information that would broaden the interests of readers. They key points in this article are based on historical occurrences that have contributed to rapid changing events in the workforce and that also created a standard for change management in a way. The information includes sufficient information regarding the history and the context of this topic. It most definitely covers a variety of topics, including the reasons for such change. In addition to that, the article addresses the key issues including globalization and technology that have heavily influenced change management. There is therefore well supported evidence throughout the article and the analysis of certain models proves that the article is referenced and can be proven with contextual information. The article itself has a clear focus on a topic and also includes detailed scholarly support throughout the text, which can be found in the reference section. The contribution considers a variety of perspectives, however, I think it primarily focuses on today’s rapidly changing world, in reference towards globalization and technology and maybe could focus more than just a few scholars. It takes an appropriate tone in providing points of view in the context of globalization and technology and is supported with appropriate references throughout the page. I think for this article there are sufficient references but more references can always be beneficial and offer more content. The article represents a neutral point of view but in a way is sort of drawn towards today’s issues in terms of globalization and technology and offers a certain point of view. It does a good job staying with the facts and avoiding opinions. In terms of article length, the only thing I would suggest is a longer intro with a little more information for the reader to have. Overall, it’s a well written entry with detailed information about change management.

"e1eb9692d0549882","""=Sexism in MGS5, relevant to an encyclopedic entry on the game?===Came back to this article to see if any progress had been made on cleaning it up. Good to see some progress has been made.I'm going to make a few points here and well.. hopefully people will be rationale and objective about it.Misinformation. This article is rife with it. It's incredibly important for an encyclopedia to present accurate information. An encyclopedia should not be an opinion column, it should not overly represent any opinion since they are not based on fact, nor relevant to a topic. I'm going to start with the 'Sexualized Portrayal of Quiet' and sadly I'm going to have to tear it apart. Please put how you feel about it or any emotion you may have about the topic aside when you read the following points;1 - No other character in any other Metal Gear title pages is given this amount of scrutiny. Quiet has been highlighted by the media as sexist, this is true. However this is not a reason for an encyclopedic entry to focus on a given character. The page is not a study of the media's (or anyone else's) reaction to Quiet as a character. There should be balance in the reception section, giving a whole section to Quiet versus no other characters is not balanced.2 - Misinformation. """"Michael McWhertor criticized Quiet's portrayal, pointing out that while the game explains that her nakedness derives from a photosynthetic skin condition, several other characters with the same condition — such as Code Talker in The Phantom Pain and The End in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater — appear fully clothed.""""Regardless of the source of information, if it is incorrect information it should not be in the entry. Quiet is naked because her lungs were burnt to a crisp, the game specifically mentions this and other fans have mentioned it on the page I believe. Code Talker and The End have the same ability correct, but they did not get set on fire and thrown out of a building. I'm really baffled this is in here because McWhertor is not an authority on this whatsoever. Kojima and the game writers are. Source it correctly or remove the information I would have said.3 - Opinion columns. This baffles me. Why are opinion pieces been taken as reception? They are not professional video game reviewers. By the media's own admission they are just someone writing their opinion about something, it's not objective. They wouldn't even claim to be unbiased as it's an opinion. You are introducing bias here by taking an opinion and presenting it for no reason other than to say """"this person didn't like Quiet's portrayal"""". If tomorrow Donald Trump wrote an opinion piece on Quiet for a media outlet, is that relevant to an encyclopedic entry about something?4 - Further irrelevant information. There are sources and information here that talk about the PlayArtsKai figurine of Quiet. Are you out of your mind?! What relevance does this have to the RECEPTION OF THE GAME??? The video game this entry is about. To start with PlayArtsKai is a completely separate company that we have no idea or information about how much Hideo Kojima was involved with. One would assume since they are completely different companies ENTIRELY that Konami simply licensed the intellectual property rights of Quiet to PlayArtsKai. It goes without saying but Twitter is not a valid source of information.5 - Dates. Numerous sources are reactions to the character Quiet and precede the date of release. Thus they are not a reception of the game itself. Hence why are they in a section called """"Reception"""" to start with.5 - Forbes contributors and Anita Sarkeesian. We seem to have established that Forbes contributors are not valid sources so I expect this will be okay to remove.Everything else seems to be sourced from valid sources who are professional video game reviewers. Although again I'd suggest that Quiet is getting an amazing amount of spotlight in the article for no other reason than controversy To any senior editors, administrators, or anyone with an interest in Wikipedia standards. It should be extremely concerning that this level of bias is present in an article that is supposed to be by and large, factual. 86.40.28.221  ==""",0,0,0,0,0,0

"092c04fa0489aa72","Deletion of AV News page Just curious why the AV News page is being deleted while its primary competitor Antelope Valley Press is allowed to have its page here unmolested.Granted we have only been in business for six years but we are every bit as a legitimate news organization as AV Press and even more so than AV Town Crier, whose page is also allowed to be here I note.Here is the content:The AV News began as a weekly print newspaper with emphasis on local news located in Lancaster, California USA. It was the second largest circulating newspaper in the area after it began publishing in 2006. In 2008, the AV News added a website and in March 2010, much like the Seatte Post-Intelligencer, the AV News transitioned to a web-only publication. The AV News covers the Antelope Valley area of Los Angeles County - mainly the Palmdale/Lancaster Urbanized Area (a US Census Bureau defined term) and areas of north Los Angeles and southeastern Kern counties, including Acton, Agua Dulce, Edwards AFB, Lake Los Angeles, Mojave, Quartz Hill, Rosamond and Santa Clarita. The newspaper is conservative in its political stance. It is currently the official news publication of the Lancaster JetHawks, a minor league baseball team in Lancaster.HistoryThe AV News was founded by Fran Paolinelli in 2006. She continues to work at the publication today. It began as a weekly print publication before dropping its print version to become a web only publication at www.avnewsday.comThe paper, conservative leaning, holds strongly held views, which can become controversial at times.Competitors in its market are the Daily News, Antelope Valley Press and the Los Angeles Times.External linksAV News Official WebsiteThe format is the same as the AV Press. There is less historical info that the AV Press because we have only been going for six years and they've been up for decades. But still, we are getting e-mails from people who use Wiki to find out about the Lancaster/Palmdale area and are surprised to find out that there are more newspapers in the area than what they find listed.I also point out that the City of Lancaster is a major advertiser with us as is the local professional baseball team.Please info me as to what more I need to include so that our page will be left on site or restore the page.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Some with a strong FYROM POV around here argue that 'Republic of Macedonia' is the only official name in use and wish to lock it in at Wikipedia.While true many nations and NGO's have chosen in the interim to use """"Republic of Macedonia""""... all nations in principle agree to honour whatever name FYROM/Greece can hammer out. When it comes to Wikipedia itself all names should be used if NPOV was actually being observed... especially since the dispute is still ongoing.  Many countries around the world still officially use FYROM (including even the US which still uses both names at times (the US Senate resolution last year condemning FYROM actually used the FYROM name).What I really think is missing from the article is that technically speaking FYROM is currently in breach of at least a few of its original UN brokered terms with Greece. (This incidentally is exactly why I the why the US government passed the resolution last year condemning FYROM for breaking terms,  why the Greek government vetoed FYROM's  recent attempt at NATO membership, , and why it will probably veto EU membership as well.)Agreement Violation #1: FYROM was supposed to stick to FYROM for external useFYROM citizens are now trying to be recognized exclusively as """"Republic of Macedonia"""" even though in Article 7 of the original UN brokered agreement (which their own leaders signed) specifically states""""the Party of the First Part reserves the right to object to any membership referred to above if and to the extent of the Party of the Second Part is to be referred to in such organization or institution differently than in paragraph 2 of the United Nations Security Council resolution 817 (1993). (which is still be FYROM I believe)Agreement Violation #2:: Refrain from propaganda against Greek cultural heritage and territoryArticle 7 and 11 of the UN agreement between Greece and FYROM state:.""""Each Party shall promptly take effective measures to prohibit hostile activities or propaganda by State-controlled agencies and to discourage acts by private entities likely to incite violence, hatred or hostility against each other.If either Party believes one or more symbols constituting part of its historic or cultural patrimony is being used by the other Party, it shall bring such alleged use to the attention of the other Party, and the other Party shall take appropriate corrective action or indicate why it does not consider it necessary to do so.The article should probably include a few real world examples to show the complaints are very real. I myself recently heard someone from FYROM claim Aristotle was actually Slavic on a forum but there are literally thousands of examples of irredentist behavior to be found. (a small subset of some recent examples that seemed relevant, verifiable and seemingly demonstrate the argument beyond the abstract) There exists a steady stream of FYROM supporters on the Alexander_the_Great article history page claiming Alexander wasn't Greek.  Top ranked FYROM websites  almost universally are writing revisionist histories that suggest Alexander was not Greek  (quote taken from the website)""""Contrary to modern Greek claims, Macedonia was never part of Greece, and the ancient Macedonians were not regarded as ancient Greeks.""""Current FYROM Prime Minister welcomes Pakistan “Macedonian” Prince Ghazanfar  and uses it as """"proof"""" of their ancient Macedonian roots.

To answer your question, yes, I am the one who left a nasty message on a user's page whose name now escapes me.  Why did I do it?  He took off the picture of Bobby Abreu that I took, looks like he tried to replace it with a copyrighted photo, and the Abreu article went for a few weeks without an image.  Now I don't mean this as anything personal against you, as I've respected you and your work for years, and you've been nothing but nice to me.  But, what I don't get is this: I can't tell you how many times I've had to re-introduce legititmate images that have been taken down by people who upload stolen images, or images of lesser quality.  This detracts from the quality of articles, and frankly, I think people who detract from the quality of articles should'nt be allowed to edit.  What I don't get is that whenever I pop-off at someone for doing this, I get busted immediately, yet no one replaced the Abreu image, or scores of others that are taken down.  Furthermore, the guy who did this is just another red link - someone who doesn't even bother to fill out a user page.  It's all a matter of common sense and etiquette - it's not the best analogy, but you just don't go to MySpace or Facebook and start putting useless garbage on other people's pages.  Same goes for Wikipedia - you just don't go around making articles worse, that legitmate volunteers have worked for years to constantly improve.  So, I take it upon myself to discourage users who don't add to the site.  And yes, I've been blocked permanently from editing Wikipedia, but look what happened to the guy who was the ultimate reason for my block.  If I'm a jerk, I'm a jerk towards people who deserve it, and these two most abundantly deserved it.  Anyway, sorry this is so long winded.

Only Hindu-nationalist chauvinists contest this.  That the idea of a spherical source arrived to India from Greece is not ridiculous, it is well-sourced to the most reliable of sources (Pingree, David """"Astronomy and Astrology in India and Iran"""" Isis, Vol. 54, No. 2 (Jun., 1963), pp. 229-246).  What's ridiculous are your empty, original-research denials.

Finally I came to a conclusion that you exploded (see your """"seen in the above insulting comments"""" which I couldn't find above, if you think they are above please quote them) because we are just from different cultures. I'm guessing (and correct me if I'm wrong) that you just don't accept the culture like mine. You say """"where you stand in your own mind with Einstein, Landau and Feynman against a world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools"""". Why do you think that """"Einstein, Landau and Feynman"""" are with me against the world? My guess: since they all are atheists who don't believe in the supernatural as you and this ironically mentioned """"world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools"""". So we offended your feelings. And we are insulting your culture. If I guessed right (and if I did, you won't protest since it would be to stand against your God, so you have an option not to respond) please accept my appologies since I never meant to make fun of your faith. I just don't believe it is true in a scientific sense so the offense is somehow automatic if an atheist (who is never offended by someone elses opinion on the scientific truth) discusses science with a believer. I should be taught by experience, since BB proponents are always offended by my texts and until now I'd never understood the reason, before I read Zimbardo, that is, and learned about deep feelings of those people. Deep feelings that atheits like myself don't have and that's why I've never uderstood them earlier.  If I'm wrong (you don't believe that there is a God) then I have to think that you are just a fool if you are feeling offended by my disagreement to a certain scientific hypothesis (actually considered by me an unscientific but to be PC we can't discuss it anymore). So suddenly the discussion became an ideological one. Advice to BB folks: state up front that you are supporting an idea that there is a God and then you won't need to feel offended since no one is going to discuss BB with you. Otherwise you'll be automatically offended by atheists like Einstein, Landau and Feynman since they don't understand fully the issue and the deep feelings that religious people have.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Despite you are talking about Persian theory of the roots of Turkish people, we all know that Turks started to migrate here circa 1000 ad when Saljuk Turks of west branch(Oghuz)started to come, but infact it is not important when they came here. The important thing is """"EVERY ONE"""" in Azerbaijan feel themselves as Azerbaijani( and not Azeri which is an invented word by Persians) Turks and believe that they r Turks and speak Turkish lang. as same as Turks of Turkey. You can come here and ask yourself one by one, you will see. It is so irrarational to say to some one that:"""" No, you r not Turk, you dont know who you are! I know! you r Azeri and Azeris are indoeuropean."""" Pls dont tell us who we r! let us to identify ourselves and we identify ourselves as a Turk whatever others like or not. About Aran, as I know we didnt have """"Eyalat Aran"""" in the Qajar era. We had """"Eyalat Azarbaijan"""" and both Azerbaijan rep. and Armenia was part of this big Eyalat as well as south Azerbaijan. Aran was part of this big land. But the important thing is, the name of land is not important here as well, the important thing is the people who live in Azerbaijan rep.( former Aran as you called) are of my race and we r same nation. You may call there Azerbaijan or Aran but the important thing is: """"here a nation live which called themselves Azerbaijani Turks!"""". You may call them whatever you want as well as their land, the important thing is what they call themselves. If they change the name of their republic, will you satisfy? what about next? will you ask them to call themselves """"Arani"""" and start to speak """"Aranian"""" language! which does not exist! Ok let's think Azerbaijanis r not Turk, so what they r? Azeri? Ok, let's call them Azeri, what is the next step? You will ask them to forget to speak in Turkish language and start to speak Persian? Or not, speak Azeri lang.? So what is Azeri lang.? where is it? Can you learn it to about 32 million people? let's thing pragmatic as well as rational. Even if your theory of roots of this people is correct historically, you cant ask them to speak neither a lang. of 1000 years ago nor Persian.Also I dont rely neither to researches of Kasravi nor Zehtabi cos both were under some believes of their backgrounds and governments. One was Paniranist other was Panturkist. Some of their researches looks really funny!About the names of Turkish places and cities, I guess you have never ever travell to Azerbaijan. If you were here, you'll see that Iranian government has changed the names during Pahlavi era! Some of them are such a funny thing that r jokes between us. for example Tabriz has a suburb in Western part of the city called """"Akhmagaya"""" which in Turkish means the rock which falling down and it is a rocky place, do u know what is its official name? """"Ahmagiyyeh!"""" the lands of stupid people! All of the Turkish names tried to change to a Persian words which looks verbally simmilar them! The fact is Persian never have been to Azerbaijan. Most of the Azerbaijani names have Armenian or Tat roots not Persian. My believe is that a mixture of differnet natios like Tats, Armenians, and other caucasian tribes lived here and then Turkish tribes of western branch have migrated to this land in large size and get married with the native people and has made the new nation which called Azerbaijani Turks nowadays. They have their own culture, music, dance, cuisine etc. which seperate them form Persians and interestingly this culture is like culture of Turks of Anatolia which believes that they r 100 percent Turk! I told you history is not important than today, the important thing is every one here feel themselves as a Turk. I dont know what they want us to feel in Tehran!The name of Azar abade gan looks wrong as well. This word cant change to Azarbaijan during history. I guess the word was """"Azar pay gan"""" (maybe) which zoroastrian Persians called, not Azar abad gan which Ferdowsi mentioned in Shahnameh and everyone got to accept it now!I had a look to your files about vote frauding which I still believe is correct as well. The diagrams of those .pdf pages show that people of Iran will give their votes to Ahmadinezhad when that company asked them before election, but you know there is unwrittenable rules in Iran which every one know.

Then maybe he hires his maid to kill his wife just cuz he doesn't like his wife any more, that's a contract killing but not an assassination because his wife isn't a figurehead and he doesn't accomplish broad change.

These supersede all the following criteria. Also, source your images fully (including all applicable from issue/page/panel, scan source, web source) and give a fair use rationale.Ensure that the picture clearly shows as much of the character as possible:The ideal image is a full-body, three-quarter picture of the character standing straight with no background, with a facing-the-camera or profile picture as the next-best.If a full-body shot is unavailable, the picture must show the whole of the head and torso (or the equivalent for non-humanoid characters).Visibly contorted poses should not be used under any circumstances.Pictures which hide significant areas the character in shadow should be avoided (exceptions apply only where the shadow is itself part of the character's look - e.g. Raven.), as should pictures where blur or distortion effects are applied.Colouring should be neutral - pictures which have a heavy colour cast, or otherwise depict the character with false colours should not be uploaded unless the cast has been removed first.Heavily stylised art should only be considered for use when the character is closely associated with the style to the exclusion of less extreme styles.Pictures which have more characters and/or objects than the subject of the article should only be used if the subject is the most prominent object - editing the picture, by cropping, obscuring and/or painting out the other characters may help to ensure this.If the character has a clearly-defined primary costume (e.g. Superman), a picture of this should be used. Otherwise, the most recent ongoing costume of the character should be used.Hopefully, you can see why I consider the Colossus and Juggernaut pictures (in addition to the earlier Turner pictures) Not Fit For Purpose. -",0,0,0,0,0,0

If you spot an error on a page, go ahead and fix it! If it's a big edit or a controversial issue, you may want to look at the article's talk page to see if the issue has been discussed in the past.

Thank you for your contributions.I notice that one of the first articles you edited  appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest. In other words, you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way, because you are, work for, or represent, the subject of that article. Your recent contributions may have already been undone for this very reason. To reduce the chances of your contributions being undone, you might like to draft your revised article before submission, and then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. See our help page on userspace drafts for more details. If the page you created has already been deleted from Wikipedia, but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft, don't hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.The one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing. It is also worth noting that Wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation. If your username does have such a name, it would be advisable for you to request a change of username.If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the New contributors' help page, where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have!

"4e656985819ac883",""" I've got a question about theropod height, and another about Dromaeosaurids... Well, 2 years ago, you gave me a hand with a school project I was working in by making this size chart.Well, I managed to get the highest possible mark in that subject, so that compensated for some weaker marks, and I managed to enter University without much pressure, so thanks again. Anyway, I was recently surfing the web and I came across this image: http://kronosaurus82.deviantart.com/art/Biggest-Ugliest-Baddest-140881861 As you can see, the animals that appear in it are the same as in the size chart you made, however, we can see some discrepances in their height. So, my question is, is this reconstruction correct in this regard? Tyrannosaurids having longer leg bones that Allosauroids and Spinosaurids (and the latter having a lower profile that other theropods) is pretty common knowledge, and longer leg bones mean more height, but, still, the mounted skeleton of Sue is not that much taller that mounted Giganotosaurus, if I recall correctly, and the mount of Spinosaurus is quite massive...Anyway, about Dromaeosaurs, do you have any idea about the environment Deinonychus and Utahraptor lived in? I ask, mainly, because of the whole feather density (or oven presence, in some cases, it seems), and, after seeing how you reconstructed Achillobator, and the reasoning behind the ratite feathering you gave it, I've been pondering how that could affect medium-large dromaeosaurs in less arid climates.In any case, could I ask you a favour, if you have the time and the inmediate means? If yes, remember the giant bird size chart?  Could you add a Velociraptor mongoliensis silouette to it, if you can? I mainly need it to driving a point straight home (not like it is that needed, the paper that describes the quill knobs on that genus is pretty good evidence for wings, but, still...). Again, if you have time. In any case, Deinonychus' height would be slighty higher if it adopted a more natural position that the crouching (or as so I see it, correct me if needed) one it is displaying in the chart. Also, do you think Aepyornis would be heavier that Utahraptor? Seeing that the model for estimating weights was deemed somewhat flawed, and that, at least in the chart, Aepyornis has a larger body, well, yeah...By the way, I like how you classified Oviraptorosaurs as an order of Aves, and Deinonychosaurs as part of Archaeopterygiformes. It, well, makes sense, that classification should get more standariced. One tends to forget about those things when thinking in a cladistic way, but, that update would be something needed to change the overall image of those animals. I may start writting them in that way, well, when I get my licenciature and start doing actual work and research in place of preparing exams. Well, better that """"when"""", """"if"""", but I hope I do.Anyway, keep up your good work, I've been following your blog, and I like what I read over there!  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

"a1e375f69ca038da","""Baroque Guitars are NOT """"ten-string guitars""""Andrew, frankly, you are mistaken. It is incorrect to refer to a baroque guitar as a """"ten-string guitar"""". No one refers to the baroque lute as """"the 24-string lute"""", but correctly as the 13-course lute. This is a well-established musicological/organological convention. """"12-string guitar"""" is the only exception to this, and that is only because the term has been disseminated by the popular """"cult(ure)"""" in the usual brainwashed ignorance of the masses. If two strings function as one string, they are a COURSE, not two separate strings. In contrast, a ten-stringed guitar has ten separate strings each of which can be separately fretted. This is not the case on the baroque guitar, which effectively only has five courses. Moreover, the term """"ten-string"""" guitar has come to signify a particular instrument, which is NOT a baroque guitar. You are evidently not a musicologist/organologist/semiologist/semantician so I don't see what you think you will achieve by being bothersome about this issue, which relates to organology and semantics.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 Hey there! I created an article for Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 and I was wondering if you could help me out by verifying the translations of the rules I made from a document posted on LTV's website . I noticed on your user page that you have written that you are fluent in Latvian so if you have the time I would appreciate your help! My main concern is that I believe they wrote that they will select ten artists and songs to compete in this national final, but during their description of the shows, I'm not sure I understood how they will select only four entries for the final during the preceding shows.   I haven't spoken/read/written Latvian (I mostly spoke Czech at home even when I lived in Latvia) in a pretty long time so I'm a bit rusty, so don't hold it against me if I misinterpreted, but here's what I got out of the rules. The first semi-final is non-elimination and just supposed to introduce the songs to the audience. In the second and third semi-finals, two songs are eliminated in each show,",0,0,0,0,0,0

"75f6b25f9cf879d1",""" Editor review Hey Nish, I'm currently up for Editor Review. I would be most appreciative if you could comment on my Wikipedia habits there and offer some advice. Thanks in advance.  Thanks for the Editor Review. I honestly, truely know that I do not want to become a Wikipedia Admin. However, I hold the same thoughts towards Wikipedia as I do towards the US military: Given the choice, I would never join up, but my personal philosophy of national service (I agree with the idea of mandatory national service of some sort, whether it be community service or military) compels me so that I plan to join the US military in some form in the future. The problem I currently face with Wikipedia is that I'm constantly fighting an uphill battle in both the preservation of information and the adding of new information to Wikipedia. Often, something that I hope to be small edit becomes a huge issue due to vandalism, edit wars, extremely overly burecratic Wikipedians (example: those who like to delete almost every image from topics under the fair use policy), etc. I don't want to end up like many of the former Admins who came to Wikipedia to add information and stayed because they became Admins and spent all their time putting out fires. However, as Wikipedia will experience exponential growth within the next decade (it will plateau when the Internet finally reaches into the third world in a big way), and with that growth will come a huge number of vandals. Honestly, I believe Wikipedia now can use 10x the number of Admins. I can't even imagine how bad it might get on here (with vandals) in a decade or so when the number of Admins has grown at a steady pace but the number of vandals is huge due to the rapid growth of Wikipedia and the Internet in general.I would prefer to not be an Admin, but I'm willing to put up with whatever it takes to preserve the good info of Wikipedia while ensuring that new info can be added properly.Any thoughts on this?  EDIT: Also, I'd like to expand my Vandal Fighting activities, but I'm not sure if I should get external programs like VandalProof. I do patrol newpages every now and then, and in the process catch many vandals. However, I usually cannot punish these vandals because of the WP:AGF policy and the fact that warnings really do nothing to repeat vandals.  I'll try my best.   Alexander Litvinenko You left this comment on my talk page:Umm...you stated that you shortened the intro here as per WP:LEAD. We were discussing the intro on the talk page, and I would have appreciated it if you would go back and discuss the intro's status on the talk page. I am restoring back the intro section, and you can make minor changes if you wish, but please don't make drastic changes without discussing. Thanks. By the way, keep up the great work with the article. =) Hopefully we can pull this to GA or FA in the near future. Best, Nishkid64 I've discussed the article on the talk page: The introduction is way too rambling and detailed which is why I shortened it. Please read WP:LEAD which recommends it is concise. Also some of the sentences don't flow well. The first sentence was a Russian Security Service agent [with a link to FSB] and later a Russian dissident is a much better summary than was an ex-FSB lieutenant-colonel with KGB experience in fighting organized crime. Tom .  In order for the article to have more impact it needs to be more concise.  You restored back the intro' i.e. a major change and said I could make 'minor' changes if I wish but 'had to discuss drastic ones', I hope you realise this is hypocritical, given that you did a major revert without discussing.  As you know, several people on the talk page have suggested to you that the intro was too long.  I promise you, the shortened introduction looks and reads better than the longer one.  The longer one does not summarise what he was in the first sentence including his dissidence, it goes straight into a narrative without any gap: """"After working in..."""", it doesn't make sense in English,""""his superiors had ordered for the assassination"""" should be """"his superiors had ordered the assassination"""".  You can't be a dissident of an organisation, see dissident.  It's got several long contiguous paragraphs instead of 4 short clearly defined ones.

We already discussed the issue at Wikipedia:WikiProject Automobiles/Conventions and decided to use hp (presumably SAE net or gross depending on time period) or kW depending on market for this unit.  I am opposed to  using PS or metric horsepower - it's just plain confusing.  One exception is if the metric hp number is """"significant"""" - as in the Bugatti Veyron with it's 1001 hp (metric) engine.  I will propose an ammendment over there to always specify """"hp SAE"""" rather than just """"hp"""" and see what people think.  Or we could just link the first occurrence of """"hp"""" to horsepower#hp (SAE) and let people use their intiution that all remaining references to hp are for SAE numbers.  I like this better.  We DO have to be precise, and I don't want to go around using random units everywhere.So let's decide here and now: I propose never using metric horsepower as a primary unit unless it's a special case like the Bugatti.  And then we should be very specific in including the SAE number. We've already decided to always include both hp and kW, and that's all well and good. As for notation, if we are to specify SAE, I would do it without parentheses since we are using the parens for kW already.  So we say """"100 hp SAE (74 kW)"""".

And because I was the only one on the qeue, I wasn't able to log out or refresh my system.During the call of Ms. Mckenzie, the POR pop box came and I informed the SME that time, Mario Raymundo, that I have not informed my customer because I know that it was system glitch. Also because tnere is no active account on the address. I was not the one who released the order but someone from Off Line Services. I endorsed the account to Mario to make necessary adjustments on the account. He texted me at around 1am to inform me that he had already talked to someone from OLS and that no POR is really required for the address so, it was released.After receiving the QA score, I also sent an email to dispute the score that I got because I believe that I did not do anything that is not in accordance with the business rules.Here are the reasons why:1. I was the only agent in auto-in for 1hour and 30mins.2. I informed my support about the situation and I was approved that there is not need to inform the customer of the POR.3. There is no active account on the address.4. I was not the one who released the order.I don't know what adjustments would be made, but I hope there will be considerations.Thank you!God bless!Andrea AMor G.

The term """"Prehistoric man"""" is no longer used by scholars and hasn't been since the 1970's becuase it is androcentric and because there really is no such thing as a group or type of people who are characteristically """"prehistoric"""".  In other words, people in prehistoric societies have no particualar commonalities except a lack of writing.  Prehistory is a rubric used by scholars to differentiate the methods used to study the past, not a type of people.  There is no such thing as a stage of personhood or social development in which a person is a prehistoric man or woman.  For example, the Inca remained a prehistoric people until the Spanish conquest and yet they ruled one of the most impressive empires on earth and still had no writen records (quipa were memory aids, not writing).  In Central America, the prehistoric period starts more than a thousand years earlier.  Further, the term is Eurocentric and based on the notion of progressive stages of """"mankind"""" like the """"stone age"""".  There are people who still use stone tools.  The """"ages as stages"""" concepts have long since been abandoned in the social sciences since they do not apply universally and can not be tied directly to other political and social developments around the world.

"6c1b827bfb871712","""What I appreciate about this discussion, is that it is being conducted by people who demonstrate a great deal of concern for the issues involved - both the subtleties and the sweep of the issue. I believe this is appropriate (though admittedly tiring) because, in legal matters, a great deal often hinges on a comma, or the inclusion/exclusion of the word """"not,"""" or other such maddening technicalities. Ergo Shakespeare's famous dictum about lawyers.Consejo de Salud Playa de Ponce v. Rullan does provide federal precedent, and a framework for discussion and debate. However the Rullan ruling is not ultimately dispositive of a U.S. constitutional question or territorial status issue, since the U.S. Supreme Court is the court of ultimate (and binding) jurisdiction in both of these areas.The language of the Rullan ruling did not grant full constitutional privileges to Puerto Ricans living on the island itself (as opposed to those living on the mainland). The Rullan court stated that """"Congress today, thus, must afford Puerto Rico and the 4,000,000 United States citizens residing therein all constitutional guarantees.""""However, as stated earlier, Puerto Rico is subject to the U.S. Congress' plenary powers under the territorial clause of Article IV, sec. 3, of the U.S. Constitution.U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 2 (""""The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States ...""""). The Rullan ruling occurred in 2008. Three years later (in 2011), insular Puerto Ricans have neither U.S. Congresspersons nor U.S. Senators, and they cannot vote for a U.S. president. Therefore insular Puerto Ricans are not fully-enfranchised U.S. citizens, and they have not been extended """"enjoyment of all rights and obligations under the U.S. Constitution.""""It is thus clear that (in the exercise of its plenary powers) the U.S. Congress has chosen to ignore the Rullan ruling. The operative word in this discussion (and I understand the frustration on both sides) is the usage of the word """"must"""" in the Rullan ruling. As forceful as that word sounds, it was mis-used by the Rullan court, because the U.S. Congress clearly ignored it.  Again...a lower federal court is not the court of ultimate jurisdiction for the issues addressed by Rullan. The U.S. Congress ignored it. Puerto Ricans (on the island) are not fully-enfranchised, and therefore do not have """"enjoyment of all rights and obligations under the U.S. Constitution.""""I hope this helps your process of consensus.

"d22ac35725b0a535","""About Claim of POV and grammar errors for this article==To: speedoflightYour claim of POV and grammar error are not clear and not helpful. For instance, I cannot see what's wrong with the sentence: """"As a versatile actor, Cheung also acted in many comedies."""" With all the different types of roles and movies he acted, it is proper to call him a versatile actor. In addition, all the movies talked in the same paragraph are comedies. As the names of movies are already given, people can easily check out by either checking the movie itself or going to imdb or any other movie related website. Neither is there any grammar error in this short sentence. Without this sentence, the whole paragraph became confusing and ridiculous. In addition, I keep telling you that Cheung's niece never explicitly said in his funeral that Cheung was suffered from depression. This can be verified by the video record of his funeral published by Cheung's family. However, you stick on introducing this mistake again and again. In addition, Ouyang Feng's job in the movie Ashes of Time is killer agent instead of assassin, this is easy to verify as the movie's name is given in the article. I don't know why you change it to the wrong one. You also remove the movie link of Happy together. I can't see any of these revisions made by you have anything to do with POV or Grammar error.As for the subtitle """"Golden Age in Film"""", it is just to address the blooming period of Cheung's Film career. Changing to """"Height in career"""" did not show anything about Film. If you want to change it to something else, at least you should not ruin the meaning. I can see that you are very anti-Chinese media. However, You should not bring personal feeling in editing. I can understand and am tolerant with Chinese media doesn't mean I would trust them. In fact, I am trying to dig out references not just from news media, but also books and original interviews, which make the job time consuming.Again, it's no problem and you are definitely welcome to do editing. However, you need to be careful not introduce new mistakes in the article. In addition, please explain you point clear for others to understand and check outAugest I keep telling you to be patient as I am still in my process to finger out a better way to put references and resources staff. However, you keep removing things in all kinds of excuses, introducing tons of mistakes, and making the article ambiguous. If you want to put whatever references you want, go ahead and do it. Or if anything you consider as needed a reference, EXPLICITLY POINTED OUT. Don't just rudely remove things with ridiculous reasons. Not """"EVERY"""" piece of sentence needs a reference, otherwise ALL articles in wiki should be removed. I spent THREE months to verify the information, correct errors and finish the current article. To dig out all the original resources may need another 3 months. I also need break during the Christmas season. Please be patient!!! Augest Please don't remove background or useful information when you do """"gramma"""" corrections. Augest I think it's better to put Chinese version of Cheung's suicide note in his Chinese version wiki page to reduce redundancy. However, I don't have time to do it yet.As for the references, I am still trying to think a better way to include them, as there are too much about him, please be patient. Thank you for the suggestions though! Augest ==""",0,0,0,0,0,0

(Narconon says drugs can be sweated out, doctors say no, etc.) How Dr. Touretzky took the story is not actually relevant, more on that at the end.There are four basic """"sides"""" depicted in it, on one side Narconon and Scientology on the opposite Science and Ex-members/critics. The stuff on Touretzky's site is supported by the latter, and disputed by the former. To a neutral observer, like the Chronicle, it's a subject of controversy. (That's what ChrisO was saying.)To explain why Dr. Touretzky's opinion of the story is irrelevant, I'll compare it to a reverse hypothetical situation; lets say Narconon felt that they had been quoted out of context. Both arguments are equally invalid since a paper isn't expected to publish what the subject wants published. (Actually, it's really similar to the lawsuit Barbara Schwarz filed against the Salt Lake City Tribune when they published her story and interview.)   On POV expressed in this and related articles on Wikipedia Incidentally, this article is an excellent example of the best case scenario of POV in a CoS/Hubbard article. It presents both sides arguments without additional comment by the paper, but unlike the Narconon/CoS claims, proof exists to back the assertions made by science. For example *Narco/tology's belief that all drugs have long longevity in fat, scrambling of 3D pictures, etc. compared to tests on human fat showing otherwise and the 3D picture theory to be unproven.*Narconon and Scientology are for the purposes of the US Government separate entities and this abbreviation is not meant to imply otherwise. They do however share similar vocabulary and ideas, and when describing these I have chosen to abbreviate.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

None disputes that."""" AF: OK. Even there are many fanatics that do not see: The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) (29.07.1974, Resolution 573) """"The Turkish military intervention was the exercise of a RIGHT EMANATING FROM AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY and the FULLFILMENT OF A LEGAL and moral OBLIGATION. 2. SilentResident: """"The 2nd invasion (August74) was an illegal......Greece, especially after the 2nd Invasion, deemed the entire operation Attila to be ILLEGAL."""" AF: Greece’s Athens Court of Appeals (21.03.1979; Case No: 2658/79): """"The Turkish military INTERVENTION in Cyprus, which was carried out in accordance with the Zurich and London Accords, was LEGAL. Turkey, as one of the Guarantor Powers, had the right lo fulfill her obligations. The real culprits . . . are the Greek officers who engineered and staged a coup and prepared the conditions for this INTERVENTION"""". Just after 5 years later than 1974, in 1979, Greece's Highest Court decided Turkish military intervention is legal without making any difference between 1st and 2nd military operation! 3. SilentResident: """"The 2nd invasion didn't aim for the restoration of any law and order, because law and order in Cyprus has already been restored after the 1st invasion.""""  AF: The Rule of Law already ended in 1963 when NEUTRAL (German) (highest) judge of Supreme Constitutional Court of Cyprus (SCCC) was forced to go out of Cyprus by Greek Cypriots, and SCCC ceased. Since, according to RoC constitution, Cyprus can only be represented by the participation of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, and there were no Turkish Cypriot in RoC government since 1963, Parliamentary Assembly of European Council stopped representation of Cyprus in PACE and expelled all Greek Cypriot representators. There was no representation of RoC during 1965-1986! When you say """"law and order in Cyprus has already been restored after the 1st invasion"""", you refer to """"the law and order in Cyprus that was forcefully existed by Greek Cypriots via expelling Turkish Cypriots, and via administrating Cyprus as the sole representator since 1963"""".  """"The law and order in Cyprus that was forcefully existed by Greek Cypriots via expelling Turkish Cypriots, and via administrating Cyprus as the sole representator since 1963"""" was not the law and order in Cyprus according to RoC's 1960 constitution.  Hence, """"1960 RoC's law and order"""" was not in execution and in place after 1st Turkish military operation. Green Line that was drawn by Britishes in 1963 was not in its place and damaged in favor of Greek Cypriots even after the 1st Turkish military operation. Only in the Turkish 2nd military operation, Turkey reached to the original Green Line drawn by Britishes in 1963.  4. SilentResident: Turkey does not have the right to: a) permanently keep its military on the island's territory even without permission from the local Cypriot authorities, even after the operations were successful and peace was restored on the island, AF: a) Turkey had/has the right of permanently keep 600 soldiers in Cyprus forever according to RoC 1960 constitution! b) eviction of all Greek Cypriots, Armenians and Jews from their homes forever and settlement of Anatolian settlers to the island AF: b) Completely very big lie of Greek Cypriots: After the hostilities in 1974, population transfers were made in accordance with the population exchange agreement between Turkish and Greek Cypriots (Third Vienna Agreement) under the auspices of United Nations on 2 August 1975;United Nations, Cyprus Population Exchange Agreement 02.08.1975 United Nations, Cyprus Population Exchange Agreement 2 August 1975. the Orthodox Greek Cypriots in Rizokarpaso, Agios Andronikos and Agia Triada and Catholic Maronite Cypriots in Asomatos, Karpasia and Kormakitis agreed to live under Turkish Cypriot administration and stayed in the north and Turkish Cypriots in Limassol agreed to live under Greek Cypriot administration and stayed in the south of the Cyprus island.

If my answer to that is not clear, there is little point taking the time to suggest actual changes.  Your clarifying question mentions the premise that each part of the UK has its own subdivisions.  The article states this, but your phrasing implies that the parts are not themselves subdivisions.  The article says nothing about that.  Besides the lack of clarity on that point (assuming your reading is correct), there is another confusion in the article: I think the majority of the people reading this article will understand that the four countries are the focus of the article and that the title of the article (Subdivisions...) refers to them.  If it is the case that the parts are not themselves subdivisions, then the article is far from clear on this point (except to the three or four who have been """"involved"""").  Hence, there are two confusions in the article: 1) the title suggests that the parts are subdivisions (because of the structure and general content of the article) and 2) since the article explicitly divides the UK into the four countries, this suggests that the parts are themselves subdivisions.  Your reading suggests that the title of the article should be """"subdivisions of the four parts of UK"""", not """"subdivisions of the UK"""".

"19e3142063a626a6","Well I suggest you read that file again and turn your thinking cap on this time. I do not need a lecture about the 'meaning' of George Wrights actions from you. George Wright has destroyed the organization along with a couple of editors here, and others at Techinc Washing. I also think that your use of the term 'Technocracy fundamentalist movement' is ignorant and demeaning. I posit that you being a 'self styled expert' that bit off the whole thing, and has instantly digested it is a little comical. You are dead wrong in your appraisal. If anything those people are the ones that are more in the genre you are suggesting. Building church`s in a Technate ? Special Interest groups in a Technate. Kolzene wrote and edited much of the Q&A;, and according to wiki that is self generated original conclusion stuff then that is a form of 'advertising' and blog 'driving' to original conclusions. To say what they are doing is a movement is sad. There are two people their that self publish stuff, and have sucked in the unwary who do not stay long. Further more you imply that movement has made 'progress' over time and become more interesting and more representative of the current status of things. That is not true. Technocracy was thought out originally to a purpose by a handful of brilliant scientists. Your implication of fundamentalism is just plain 'stupid'. You say that you have not read the book for a while ?Well I suggest you read the last two chapters with a view to opening your mind a little, and with a view to thinking about the design.  http://technocracy-incorporated.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Technocracy%2520study%2520guide.pdfTechnocracy%20study%20guide.pdf  There were 200 to 300,000 people for a while that thought this was not only the way to go but worked toward that end. Now there are 4 people on the NET site and Two people on the TechCa site that claim they and their 'belief system' , reward and punishment, 'contract', and church building, and referendum Democracy voting voting is 'smart'These people are ignorant. You sound ignorant now also. Technocracy is important. It deserves to be fairly brought out. As to your suggestion about what I can do, you suck, and so does the horse you road in on. Oh and I did not 'assault' anyone, I told the truth about George, and since when do you decide what is unacceptable ? You are an ignorant person, or perhaps a believer like them.

"7bb416237e397653","""I can think of several citations for the Personality section, most of them quotes by Jafar himself.

He wears a metaphorical mask of normalcy throughout the film, establishing himself as a cool-headed schemer and gaining the trust of those around him (""""You are most gracious my liege"""" - """"I assure you your highness, it won't happen again""""), despite his rather untrustworthy physical appearance. Even with this mask, Jafar's villainous tendencies tend to seep through and become apparent to the viewer, particularly in the opening sequence, where Jafar displays no remorse in sending Gazim the Thief to his death in the Cave of Wonders, simply proclaiming that """"Gazim was obviously less than worthy"""" in a rather dry tone of voice. The deleted song """"Humiliate the Boy"""" also establishes Jafar as an emotional sadist, getting a laugh out of seeing """"another fellow's dreams turn into nightmares one by one"""" and treating the Genie in an especially harsh manner (one only has to watch the video, a link to which is provided, in which Jafar viciously tugs the genie's beard several times whilst shouting orders like """"Do as I say""""). It is not until Jafar gains control of the Genie's lamp that he fully shows his true colors, becoming even more arrogant and short-tempered with his subjects after usurping power from the Sultan (""""Don't talk back to me you big blue lout! You are to do what I order you to do! Slave). It is this impulsive behavior that leads to his downfall, as he uses his third wish to become an omnipotent genie, unaware of the life inside the lamp that he now has to endure.Jafar is usually shown to be somewhat comedic and plucky (giving a slightly human side to his usual malevolence, a trait not often seen in Disney villains), even in his times of evil and cunning, proclaiming """"Ewww..."""" when contemplating decapitation. This, however, doesn't keep Jafar from having a sub-par sense of humor himself, spurting several puns in a row while keeping Aladdin and his friends from getting the lamp during the film's climax (""""Your time is up!"""", """"Don't toy with me!"""", """"Things are unraveling fast now, boy!"""", """"Get the point?"""", """"I'm just getting warmed up!"""") This comical humor does not carry over in the film's direct-to-video sequel, which aimed to make Jafar more sinister and ruthless, though it is referenced in Jafar's role in """"Hercules and the Arabian Night"""".Can't think of a citation for that last sentence so maybe we should leave that out.

I""""ll certainly have to include it in my list of places to visit.  I can't speak for any of the areas in the Pacific Northwest (which is home to hundreds of high, impressive falls), in North Carolina, according to Kevin Adams' """"North Carolina Waterfalls: A Hiking and Photography Guide"""", our state is estimated to have around 1,000 - 1,500 falls in the state, most of them in Transylvania County, NC (aka """"The Land of Waterfalls"""").  Estimates are that TC contains between 400-500 """"major"""" waterfalls in an area slightly smaller than the City of Hamilton (390 sq mi versus Hamilton's 439 sq mi).  As for what you call """"major"""" - that's pretty much up to the viewer.  One man's gushing torrent is another man's damp spot on the side of a rock.  In TC, a major waterfall is usually considered at least 15-20' high - not including talus - or having enough current to be an obvious waterfall (such as Hooker Falls).If you ever get the chance to visit NC, please do.  We've got a lot of beautiful, rugged country.  To this day, I get reports about new waterfalls discovered by people who are just now able to scamper through some of the roughest terrain the east coast has to offer.    Part of the problem with defining the """"City with the most waterfalls"""" is that neither term is overly well defined.  """"City"""" can mean """"town limits"""" or """"Metropolitan Area"""" or any other of a dozen different definitions.  Then you have the problem with the exact definition of a waterfall.  Ergo, you have the problem.   Trail in New ZealandI don't know of another town with that many waterfalls.  However I do know that when it rains really heavily the valley that you walk up first on the Milford Track, has over 300 waterfalls. -   WaterfallsThere are loads of waterfalls in Washington State in the Olympic and Cascade mountains.  I am only really documenting major waterfalls, not all the little ones.  Konrad    FudgeWhere on the blogspot site does it say that, you need to link to the specific page. And a fansite doesn't really count as a reliable source. Twa2 WaterfallsRegarding the 100 waterfalls Hamilton, I am unaware of another city area with that many.  There are probably """"areas"""" with about that much, such as the Columbia River Gorge, but the exact number there I am ignorant of and they are not that many major ones.  Here on the Olympic Peninsula we have a number of falls, but it is a really large area and probably does not reach the density that you have indicated there in Hamilton.

Just as if one were to read about sea stars and there is a mention that they eat phytoplankton, mentioning that jellyfish also eat phytoplankton might be useful for greater understanding of the sea stars (are they in the same waters, do they compete for food).  To present this information as if CPI(M) members are singular in their violence is not a correct viewpoint if violence is ongoing between many parties.

The value of the random variable will vary from trial to trial as the experiment is repeated.There are two types of random variable - discrete and continuous.A random variable has either an associated probability distribution (discrete random variable) or probability density function (continuous random variable).I think this is definitely an improvement but it should be pointed out that there exists r.v.'s which are neither discrete nor continuous (for example take the sum of one r.v. of each type) The current definition is bad in that it is neither clear to the lay reader nor specific to the technical reader. The above definition is far better on both counts and so I will put it on the page.   BTW, sorry about the no summary edit, I hit the enter key accidentally.   Examples A coin is tossed ten times. The random variable X is the number of tails that are noted. X can only take the values 0, 1, ..., 10, so X is a discrete random variable. A light bulb is burned until it burns out. The random variable Y is its lifetime in hours. Y can take any positive real value, so Y is a continuous random variable. """"I think the above definition (for the original reference, pls search via google) explains to me that it is a mapping between a value and the sequence number of that value, rather like a numeric index to a database record. This would appear to allow greater generalization in statistical definitions and algorithms. The earler Wikiedia definition led me to comment on another Wikipedia definition incorrectly because I think I may have misunderstood the concept after looking at this Wikipedia definition.A random variable is a function that assigns a numerical value to an event. This example:just assigns another event to an event. Could we change it to something like:Consider a game where if a 6 is rolled on a fair six-sided die, player 1 wins, and otherwise, player 2 wins. Let X represent the number of times player 1 wins. Thenandor maybe include an example of a continuous random variable? What do you think?  This section should begin with a sentence of the form """"A random variable is ..."""". To avoid this is to show that you don'",0,0,0,0,0,0

It began in the early 16th century when King Henry VIII failed to receive an annulment from the Vatican and subsequently broke English Christianity away from the pope and declared himself the absolute spiritual ruler of the Church of England. He then proceeded on a campaign to persecute and murder all who opposed his personal claim to the """"English papacy."""" Things only went downhill from there. In subsequent generations the throne passed between Catholic and Protestant heirs, each persecuting their political enemies. The final result came under Queen Elizabeth I which settled England as a Protestant country. In the following centuries, England became the leading herald of anti-Catholic propaganda around the world, as the British crown persecuted Irish Catholics and waged war against the Catholic kingdoms of France and Spain.""""""""Sadly, the more things change the more they stay the same. The world may have moved into the 21st century, but British politics is still locked in the 16th century. To date Catholics are still forbidden from the British royal family. Government officials still mock the pope and the Church behind closed doors.

"761acf73d40b0e25","""As I'm sure many of you have surmised, there is something going on behind the scenes to which most editors of Wikipedia are not privy. My purpose here today is to expose it. In doing so, you may be tempted to minimize the problem by vilifying David Gerard or Carbonite, but their actions are only part of the surface manifestation, and penalizing them will only accentuate the dilemma. Finding fall-guys to punish will not fix the problem because the underlying problem is the system of punishment.Systems of punishmentOn Jpgordon's talk page, we see Carbonite punish the administrator with a forced """"time out."""" In response, Jpgordon leaves a message on Carbonite's talk page saying, """"Good call."""" Jpgordon's subservience to the system of punishment is directly evident in this example. Methods of indirectly empowering systems of punishment also exist.We can disagree with Carbonite's methods while enabling them at the same time by acknowledging Carbonite's ability to control our will. But, does Carbonite have the innate ability to control our will, or do we grant him that power? Obviously, Carbonite cannot coerce us without our agreeing to allow him that authority. Our mind is our own, and our will is based purely on the systems we acknowledge.When we buy into a system of punishment, as many of us have at Wikipedia, we are purchasing the whole package. It come complete with vandals, disrespect, flame wars, and content ultimately controlled by a very few individuals with little or no prescriptive editing experience.PrescriptionLanguage requires prescription. This is evident with a little thought-experiment involving two extremes. If you could only communicate with words that remained the same indefinitely after they are coined, communication would be entirely possible. However, in the opposite extreme, where official definitions instantly amended whatever meaning every disparate context assumed, propaganda and """"misuse"""" would soon render that language ineffectual.Within the intended construct of Wikipedia, we don't have to understand how strong singular definitions empower a civilization. The Darwinism of thousands of disparate editors and competing ideas will naturally lead to a prescriptive definition. In areas of Wikipedia where we don't have top-down control of content, this is exactly what happens. Unfortunately, systems of punishment have become the rule at Wikipedia instead of the exception. Our love for this project creates expectations for its potential, but the fear of not reaching these expectations allows others to control us, closes our eyes to corruption and content control, and ultimately destroys the thing we love.

"a33daee6243ef055","""==bcm versus km³==Dear Gene Nygaard,You said that generally everyone understands km³. I am not sure about this statement and find this use quite unusual and misleading. Could you please give any example in gas industry where km³ is used (maybe just some newspaper article)? Also, if youd could find any article in wikipeedia about gas fileds or pipelines, which use km³, I would like to get a reference.  Google """"natural gas"""" """"km3""""  823 hitsNote that Google, as far as I know, won't search for the ³ character, but this gets those that use either html superscripts, or just """"km3"""" and the like.There are other ways to find more of them.  You will of course find many using bcm as well.  But as I pointed out, that may be jargon used within the industry, but it is not known outside the industry (there might possibly be other little pockets of its usage in other contexts, even less known). another search, on AltaVista:km³ """"natural gas"""" 3130 hits. AltaVista appears to treat ³ and 3 as synonymous, unlike Google. You can limit them to .gov sites, or to .edu sites, too, to see that this isn't """"newspaper usage"""" but in fact more likely to take place in more serious and professional contexts.  BTW, if you were arguing about """"tcf"""" you'd maybe have a better case.  That is common enough in the industry, more so than """"bcm"""", that it is better known outside the industry, too.  I am able to use different search engages. However, could you please give any example of use km³  as an unit of capacity of gas pipeline? Concerning tcf (trillion cubic feet) - it's used more in the US gas industry, while bcm is used mainly in Europe. Don't see problem with this. If you look the external links of this artcile, you will find both: tcf and bcm, depending of the source. In the petroleum industry the unit systems used are Oilfield and Metric like what was mentoned above, all depending on where you are and who you are working with. However I have never come across km³ being used to describe gas field sizes or gas production and if someone was to describe a field or gas production in such a way to someone in the industry it would have no revelace to them, it is not a standard of unit. It would have to be Bcm, Mcm, E3M3, Bcf, Tcf, MMscf, Mscf etc.   Surely, we writing for a general audience not only for people in certain industries.  km³ is standard SI if some people in some industry want to use something else, then that's their problem.  P.S. Hello Gene. ɪmp  Very true Jimp we are writing for a general audience. And when i searched some news articles by the likes of Forbes, CNN Money etc on Google news in the past month for the phrase km3 in relation to gas/gasfield/ gas field/ """"natural gas"""" it returns one result from Petroleum World. However the units tcf, bcf, bcm return   at least 102, 147,  51 hits when used with the above phrases. And these are from Forbes, Reuters, CNN Money, Globe and mail which i think you would agree are also writing for the General Audience. The numbers are in their hundreds of thousands when you do just a general web search for tcf, bcf and bcm compared to the 823 km3 turns up. So its not really just """"some people in some industry"""" using these terms.  Cheers  Sure it is.  But that's beside the point; we at Wikipedia choose to use standard unit symbols, not all the various off-the-cuff possibilities, and km³ is the standard symbol for 1,000,000,000 m³.  It isn't surprising at all that financial magazines are too innumerate when it comes to units of measure to even understand what they are, so sure they get passed on unchanged.  So what?

"7b988bd2ea7a16c5",""" No, I do think that Wikipedia should mention this effort on Buckley's part and have not said otherwise. Absolutely. Buckley's attempt to read Rand out spanned his whole career, N.R. articles through the 1960s, the """"RIP"""" at her death, and straight up to his book Getting It Right. It's not only important to Buckley's own history but to the history of the American Intellectual Right. Rand's friends and students influenced important people on the Goldwater campaign, in the Reagan Administration, and in the media, such as Limbaugh, Beck, Stossel, Napolitano, Neal Boortz, etc., who have all cited her repeatedly, recently and favorably, recommending the very book that the Buckley/Chambers's review was all about. No, Rand was not a """"conservative"""" and my admiration of Rand, though contextual, includes respect for the fact that she never called herself a """"conservative"""" and never would have wanted to be part of such a movement. She doesn't get to decide these things any more than Buckley does, however, and it is Rand's actual, important and on-going influence among self-described conservatives that determines this. Limbaugh, for example, has extensively quoted from Atlas Shrugged on his air  without qualification  and more than once. Even Sean Hannity on his Fox program has favorably mentioned the new Atlas Shrugged movie. Tea Party activists cite Rand much more than they do Buckley, and carry photos of Rand at their demonstrations. Times have changed since Buckley's attempt.-  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

After checking over your behavior on Wikipedia a little bit, I think you might be interested in what it's like to have a penis.  Your incessant edit warring (that you childishly deny), and your infuriating, relentless self-importance are all the evidence that I need to conclude that you either a) don't have a penis (much like Gwen Gale) or b) possess such a small penis that it just doesn't count.  Anyway, enjoy this poem - just for you.I'll tell you a short poem; I'll try to make it quick. The subject is quite simple: The joy of having a dick.Penises are super things; Daedalus969 should be jealous. An organ surrounded by sensitive skin. That's smooth and rarely hairlessIt starts to grow dramatically, When you're about thirteen. Your testicles on either side; Your willy in between.It dangles neatly down below; Soft, obedient and loyal. At the slightest hint of lust, It's ready to uncoil.It often has a mind all of its own; It's like a wild untamed beast. It squirms and writhes and stretches out; When you expect it least.Sometimes, yes, it misbehaves; Erecting when it shouldn't. A bumpy train ride sets it off; Just when you wish it wouldn't.And during the summer, wearing little, sunning on the beach. The slightest sight of shaking boobs Makes it squirm just like a leech.Handle it with love and care; For it can give great pleasure. Has it grown since last weekend? And when did you last measure?Some people fret about its size; They give it lots of thought. Is thirteen inches long enough? It makes guys quite distraught.They peek across in urinals, To compare and try to see But if another glances back at them. There's no way they can pee.Masturbating is a sin; That's what some folk believe. But those are just old wives' tales; Cuz it really can relieve.Without this fabulous organ, No shag would be complete. Lesbians will try their best; But must admit defeat.It has to main bodily functions I'm sure you'll all agree. To start a whole new life and of course daily to peeBut I think the thing that's marvellous; About that one eyed brute. Is that when its trying to procreate, It knows which fluid to shootAnd always it remains with you; Until you're old and frail. Don't take it out in public though, or you'll be thrown in jail.And so to summarise I'd say with certainty, that every male loves his little friend But girls, no matter what we do, Please don't fold, spindle mutilate and NEVER NEVER Bend!!!",0,0,0,0,0,0

His edit today goes back to something I said at AN yesterday about American admins, me included, being clueless about football and footballers. I don't know if the edit he made today is good or not - I know there's a timestamp you guys use and it looks like he updated that, so it's not clear vandalism to me. (More on that in a sec.) To your IPs: the first IP hasn't edited today at all, and the second has made one edit today. That may be long term disruption, but it's not current vandalism.

The parachute pack clipped-on to the harness at the front (chest) and only needed to be attached immediately before jumping. For confined rear turrets the pack was sometimes stored outside the turret in the fuselage, the gunner only needing to reach behind him to open the two rear doors of the turret and reach into the fuselage. Where the tail gunner stowed his parachute depended on personal preference and to some extent, on his physical size.The internal dimensions of the Lancaster and its turrets was somewhat wanting in terms of space, as when the basic aircraft had been designed (as the Manchester) the normal flying clothing was limited to perhaps a Sidcot suit and a parachute. With the increasing later use of such apparel as Irvin jackets and Mae Wests and other impedimenta the average crew member became a much bulkier figure, leading to difficulties in exiting the aircraft in an emergency, the dimensions of the escape hatches remaining unchanged. This possibly accounts for the higher crew losses for the Lancaster compared to the Halifax, which was also much roomier inside.",0,0,0,0,0,0

However, it links to a Dallas News article, which says no such thing, to a Dallas News interview, which also does not contain this statement, and mentions a WFAA interview, which I've been unable to find. I've checked four different interviews with Ahmed and he does not explicitly describe it as a rebuilt clock in any of them.If such an interview exists and the statement was not an interpolation by NPR, it would be nice to have a direct link, a quote and a date.The problem with the statement is that it provides inadequate background for the rest of the article. When the story broke on 9/15, the device was consistently described by the media as """"a homemade clock"""" or """"an invention"""".  The fact that it was a reassembled commercial clock was mentioned in passing by a WFAA article (which quoted Irving police) on 9/16 but otherwise mostly ignored. It only went """"viral"""", so to speak, when Dawkins waded into the controversy on 9/20 and his comments got picked up by the conservative media.Much of the immediate reaction, from Obama's tweet and Zuckerberg's invitation to Dawkins' lashing out, seems inexplicable if the device in question was acknowledged to be a rebuilt commercial clock from day 1, but makes sense if the device was initially assumed by everyone to be a genuine homemade clock.

My assertion is NOT that the middle-finger incident should be included in the subject article (I started) because of news reports, as you contend.  If you will review the foregoing, the reason why I cited the news reports is because a flagrantly reckless comment was inserted that what is of issue now is not worthy of documenting when the exact opposite is true; the news reports is best evidence in that regard, and the person who said it is not worthy has only but his mouthan inferior source of 'evidence,' relatively speaking.  It is noteworthy, and, if you can come to appreciate the context of the subject's profession and for which has become known to be involved in, then you'll come to appreciate the significance it plays out in the essential need to properly reflect the entirety of the trial in which the subject became a major fixture as co-counsel.Your example of everyday political speeches is seriously an aytypical example by which to convey your point:  Contrary to a mudane, everyday speech, here, an attorney just allegedly got out of court in obtaining a siginficant finding in his client's favordefeating immense odds and seemingly going against the court of public opinionand just afterwards gathered with his team at a restaurant just down the street from that historic victory, during which he released the manifestation of his emotions, etc., as one could imagine.  This was included as part of a segment of the whole article of the article-there is no article specifically on this incident, so let's also come to appreciate that.And, to the contrary that this incident is of interest only at the moment, more and more discussions are being held about the audacious incident, and has cultivated an interest in what happens next, as if it is leading to a whole host of other actions (whether that includes the filing of a bar complaint, etc.), and this leads us to the national grand scale interest of the audacity of officers of courts acting in such a manner, etc.Furthermore, I concede that Wikipedia is not in existence for the greater good, and that was never my contentio.  Again, you misunderstood the context I place in the words, """"public interests."""" Going back to the above, it is incontrovertible that is of the interests of the public, and, consequently, it should be documented well because, as noted in the latter paragraph, it is beginning to take shape in having a lasting impact on what we have come to expect from individuals, such as the subject of the article.Let otherscertainly at least those who helped me in creating the articlechime in with their thoughts before you take an action on behalf everyone else.

In Daylight saving time I addressed the problem by moving those books into the Further reading section, which isn't exactly appropriate, as Further reading is supposed to be for books that weren't used as sources; I attempted to work around the problem by having the first footnote mention the existence of the full citations in the Further reading section. In Philitas of Cos I addressed it by renaming the section that is ordinarily called References to Notes and having a new References section containing the list of full citations; but it's a bit weird and non-uniform to have the section title move to the newly-added section when you need the new section. I vaguely recall seeing an list-of-full-citations section called Bibliography in some other article but that's not appropriate either, as the MOS says that Bibliography is for works written by the subject of the article. I don't know of any useful guideline in Wikipedia in this problematic area. The approach currently taken in Tourette syndrome #References isn't clearly wrong, and is arguably better than what's in Daylight saving time or in Philitas of Cos, not only because it doesn't abuse Further reading and References as titles, but also because it puts the most important references first.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Unfortunately, due to the tyrannical trends of namby pamby liberalism (Labour UK, for example), not much genuine research can be done in the subject, because it's quite politically incorrect these days. For example, when a university professor says that on average Black people score lower in IQ tests than white people, said professor gets voted out of tenure 600 to 1. So it's not good practice for libertarian capitalists to bother trying to counter argue against all this namby pamby left wing crap. Labour UK is a twisted experiment, which, although capitalist and ostensibly right wing, has introduced very bizarre left wing projects in to the political playing field: such as, teaching young children about homosexuality in schools, trying to make gay hate a crime like race hate, trying to make condemnation of monotheistic religions a crime, with use of the truth distorting term 'incitement to religious hatred' etc. We are on the losing side, those of us who love truth.

This really says a lot of the extent of authority as Mr. Irving enjoyed (then). He is still widely believed to be one of the greatest authorities on WW2 and of the nature of the Nazi regime. All this still stands, as everyone can witness for himself by reading some of his books, which are available free of charge from his website as Downloads.However ONE chapter of the aforementioned book was about the holocaust. And because of that David got subjected to a smearing campaign hitherto unseen in scope. Booksellers was pressured not to sell his books (no mention of this on Wikipedia) - that is why he gives them away for free.

"90d65fb0b7d9c928","""Here's a helpful passage from Natalie J. Purcell's Death Metal Music: The Passion and Politics of a Subculture, published by the very respectable McFarland ():Across the sea, in the UK, Napalm Death would release Scum in 1987. The two-sided album was extremely influential. Though side one featured very punk-influenced guitaring, the second side displayed the impressive Death Metal guitarwork of Bill Steer, which would spur the Grindcore movement. The tempos of the album were incredibly fast, with quadruple-time beats and extremely short songs. The album also featured deep grunted vocals advocating leftist politics. Napalm Death followed Scum with the equally extreme 1988 release From Enslavement to Obliteration. Soon, British Grindcore bands like Unseen Terror, Ripcord, Heresy, Concrete Sox, Carcass, The Electro-Hippies, and others began popping up.... Carcass """"adapted the Grindcore formula to include more metallic, chugging sections.""""—  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, I looked on LDS.org and failed to find any mention there of his assignment. I see two other seventies (though I can't remember who) that are listed as Assistant Executive Directors of the Temple Department, but under Zivic's LDS.org biography, that assignment is not listed. Is it possible that this was a previous assignment that he has now been released from? As soon as LDS.org has an updated list of assignments, I guess we'll know for sure. Please respond on my talk page, as I don't habitually check other users' talk page for a response. Thanks.   Hi!  I do recall that LDS.org's bio on Elder Zivic does not list the Temple Department assignment.  Actually, as I recall, it does not list anything subsequent to his previous service in an area presidency.  I obtained the information from other directories I reviewed.  There are actually 4 assistants at the present time to William Walker, in his role as Executive Director.  Hope that helps some.  Thanks for the question to ensure we're on track.   On the list we have, I see Elder Choi, Elder Zivic, and Elder Gibbons listed as Assistant Executive Directors of the Temple Department. So now my question is, who is the 4th person you spoke of? Also, on the list that you are taking this information from, does it contain any other assignments of general authorities that we can put on that page? Again, please respond on my talk page. Thanks.   It is Elder Baxter and I have updated that portion of the table/info box.  Thanks!   It seems you forgot to respond to the second question of my last post, so I'll ask it again: On the list that you got the information from about the Temple Department Assistant Executive Directors, does it list any other assignments for seventies that we don't have on the WP list? Any additional information you can contribute would be appreciated. Again, please respond on my talk page. Thanks.   I didn't forget, but I don't believe there is anything else that we would add, so I probably just skipped over the inquiry. ) There are some items that need to be officially announced before they are included as well.  Thanks!    There are other changes, but we'll have to wait until they're officially announced? I really wish you hadn't said that. My curiosity is piqued. I won't ask what these changes are, much as I want to. You're probably not at liberty to say. One question I can ask: Where are you getting all this information? Do you by any chance have access to the CDOL? What Church position do you hold that allows you to be privy to this information? These are questions I feel I can ask. In the meantime, for the sake of my sanity, any additional information you feel you can give me, even if we have to wait until it's officially announced to list it here, would be appreciated. If you can tell me anything, I promise that I won't make it public. However, if you can't give me any more details until it's official, I understand completely.

"c50e903ec1b4eddb","""Well, your comments certainly sound authoritative!  Why do you privilege Friedrich's narrative over Bazzana's?  His biography is quite clear on this point: """"[Glenn's] birth certificate gave his name as 'Gold, Glenn Herbert.'  The family name had always been Gold, and when his grandfather...established the family business in 1913, he gave it the name 'Gold Standard Furs' (pun presumably intended).  All of the documents through 1938 that survive among Gould's papers give his surname as 'Gold,' but beginning at least as early as 1939 the family name was almost always printed as 'Gould' in newspapers, programs, and other sources; the last confirmed publication of 'Gold' is in the program for a church supper and concert on October 27, 1940."""" (Bazzana, Wondrous Strange, 24).Now, I don't want to stand in the way of your sanctimoniousness, but I believe that documentary evidence weighs in as the only proof of historical fact.  Your quotation from Friedrich offers no documentary evidence  only an undated business card.Bazzana goes on to discuss the regrettable climate of increasing xenophobia that apparently prevailed in Toronto at the time, and the influence this may have had on the (documented!) name change, but any thoughtful person can surmise from the dates (1939-40) that this may have been the case.In any event, this entire discussion is much less """"problematic and harmful"""" (whatever that means) than inane and boring.

It's all very nice to be able to laugh and say """"you're wrong on all these points"""", but in fact this section is misrepresenting Wicca just as much as the Harry-haters.The heading itself seems to imply that witchcraft and Wicca are synonymous. Wicca is merely one variety of modern witchcraft.Wiccans commune with the dead and the spirit world. At Halloween (or Samhain), for example, we invite the spirits of our ancestors and deceased loved ones to return and share our warmth and companionship for an evening. Extensive spirit contact by Wiccans (via ouija board and channeling) is recounted in A Voice in the Forest by Jimahl diFiosa, an Alexandrian High Priest.Sorcery: well, Wiccans definitely perform magic. The word 'sorcery' has a sinister sound to it, which perhaps doesn't fit with Wicca so well, but if it merely means 'performing magic', then certainly.Occult symbology: this is merely a catch-all phrase for anything that looks a bit 'occult', isn't it? Well, Wicca is very definitely 'occultism', since it deals with magic and the hidden parts of reality. And yes, Wiccans use occult symbols, such as zodiacal signs.Curses are of course forbidden in Wicca, as is all malicious or harmful magic.Demon posession: Whoever accused Wiccans of practicing demon posession is pulling a swift one. Wiccans practice what could loosely be called """"posession"""": calling our God or Goddess into the body of a priest or priestess. I guess this is fairly similar to what Christians call """"being filled with the spirit"""", but if you happen to consider the Wiccan gods to be demons (and of course they're demons, aren't they, since any deity other than Jehovah is a demon), then you could term this """"demon possession"""", feeling only a tinge of guilt at your verbal chicanery.The real reason why Harry Potter has nothing to do with Wicca is because Harry Potter is fantasy, presented in a manner that has virtually no resemblance to the reality of modern witchcraft, whether it be Wicca or any other variety. How many kids watch the Power Rangers and decide they want to enter law enforcement as a ranger when they grow up? The Texas Rangers, just like the Power Rangers, wear uniforms, fight bad guys, protect law and order, have headquarters and so on. The parallels are all there, but any rational person will immediately discern the vast differences.I don't think we need to misrepresent our religion, simply because some people get the flutters whenever the words 'magic' or 'occult' are mentioned. Lets show a bit of backbone, rather than trying to turn our faith into what we think Christians want it to be! ★ """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think you were encountering a situation where the NRHP name in our LA list was a red-link and was different than the name of a pre-existing article on the site, and you handled it correctly by revising our list to keep showing the NRHP name (as it is a list of NRHPs) while wikilinking to the pre-existing article.  And you added the NRHP infobox, keeping the NRHP name there (as it should be).  Further, I edited the article intro to mention the alternative name.  And further, i created a redirect at the NRHP name for the site.  I think we talked about how to do redirects a while back....It would have been similar if the problem had been we had created a new NRHP article already, before finding the pre-existing one.  Then I would have supported merging our material into the older article, and converting our new article into a redirect to the older one.  That gets to the same result as above.  In mergers, I do think it is courteous to merge the newer article into the older one, so that the older history of edits stays with the article.  Even if the newer article name is better, because the merged article can be moved with its entire long history to the newer name, after.Anyhow i think you handled it right.

I can say that, in the case of Jacksonville, although the governments of the (a) City of Jacksonville and (b) Duval County are unified, there is (or ought to be) separate reckoning of the city's and county's area, because Duval County also contains three other cities (Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, and Neptune Beach), which are not part of the City of Jacksonville (they have their own, separate police departments, for example—even though the Jacksonville Public Library is county-wide).The government website of the City and Borough of Juneau says it has 2,593.6 square miles of land and 487.6 square miles of water, for a total of 3,081.2 square miles.

I am sure there is some truth in that, but I think the reply is that Wikipedia shouldn't about """"popular parlance"""", it is an encyclopedia and needs to be about scholarship, about detailed and correct information, sourced as well as possible. To put that more grandly, it is about educating the world. To illustrate this point, in the """"popular parlance"""" of much of the world, """"Great Britain"""" and """"England"""" are much the same thing, but by education people learn the difference between them. To have an article on British India here, even one with much improvement needed to it, is a powerful tool in that process of education.On Nichalp's suggestion that """"British India"""" should be redirected to British Raj"""", I and others do not agree with that, for all of the detailed reasons advanced so far: please see the discussion here and also at Talk:British Raj. And I believe Philip Baird Shearer has said correctly somewhere above that there is a consensus against such a redirect. Fowler&fowler; asks """"Would you be opposed to """"British India"""" being redirected to this overview article, British rule in India instead of """"British Raj?"""" """" I, of course, am one of those who believe Wikipedia needs a discrete article, so I should be opposed. In general, I do agree with the """"overview article"""" idea which has developed, and if I am invited to help in particular ways then I shall be glad to do what I can, but I do not believe 'British India' would be a possible title for that overview article, as the term has a correct meaning which is significantly less than the whole of India.  One thought which I believe Fowler&fowler; had some time ago which does strike me as another possible compromise would be to merge Provinces of British India into British India. For reasons of space, the separation might one day be an advantage, but as matters stand at the moment this might be a rationalisation which could make sense to all of us?I hope these comments are helpful.

Since the heart of the conflict seems to be how you and I regard your edits in light of WP policy, it seems best to isolate the points of policy where our understanding differs, in hopes that we can establish areas of common ground from which we can work out other differences (or at least agree about what we irreconcilably disagree).

"f3998c1c6b2d9e6f","""==King George County, VA==There seems to be some a contridiction of the status of King George County. The King George County page indicates that King George County is NOT a part of the Washington-Baltimore Metropolitan Area. Yet, according to the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area page, it is.This also brings to light a local controversey regarding King George County and whether or not it is part of the Northern Neck of Virginia. Historically, King George County has been included as part of the Northern Neck. The Northern Neck Tourism Council website lists locations in King George County amongst its historical sites and museums, and the King George County Homepage labels the county as the """"Gateway to the Historic Northern Neck"""". I was educated in Northumberland County, Virginia, and this is what we were taught during our segment on local history for 11th grade US History, that there are FIVE counties in the Northern Neck, including King George County.However, until 11th grade, I had always grown up under the assumption that the Northern Neck consisted of only four counties: Northumberland, Lancaster, Westmoreland, and Richmond counties. Locals think of the Northern Neck more as a community with similar  values and interests, rather than a geographical area. King George county is considered to be """"suburban"""", part of the Washington DC urban sprawl and therefore doesn't share the same community interests as the rest of the Northern Neck.This article from the Fredericksburg Free-Lance Star highlights both sides of the King George debate.The inclusion of King George County as part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area stems from three facts: King George's proximity to Fredericksburg, its inclusion in the Washington DC media market, and the presence of the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren. However, the historical connections between King George County and the Northern Neck shouldn't be dismissed. It wouldn't be inappropriate to consider King George County as part of both, as Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area seems to be a statistical category, while the Northern Neck is a historical/geographical region.I have also added this discussion to the pages on both the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and the King George County pages. If there is no further discussion or objection, I will edit the Northern Neck page to include mention of the local debate on the status of King George County.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

As for the substance of the issue:1. Reasons of Capital move to Kharkov. ProhibitOnions introduced to the article an idea that one of the reasons of the capital move was the fact Kharkov's was more dominated by ethnic Russians than Kiev. This claim has some logic in the context of the events, but I have not seen this claim made in any serious source. If this is due to my ignorance, I suggest ProhibitOnions provides at least some references, or, if he can't find them off hand, at least gives some hints where he saw this info, so that it can be checked. His statement on the talk page that """"many historians concede"""" on this is too vague of a reference. If this is indeed his own speculation based on his interpretation of the logic of events, this qualifies as original research, whose place is current scholary or popular publications, personal web-sites, etc., but not an encyclopedia, which should reflect an established knowledge.2. Possible role of famine in the capital return to Kiev.  PO agrees, that the discussion of the issue belongs to other articles but thinks, it is also relevant here. My point is that this info is factually accurate, but its relevance is too remote. Deliberate killing milions of people was a horrible crime, but Kiev itself, unlike the vast regions of Ukrainian countryside, was not ravaged by famine. Should the info on the deliberate famine caused by the actions of the Bolshevik government be introduced into every article related to any Ukrainian topic? If PO helps me understand why famine should be in Kiev article, I am open to ideas. 3. Finally, PO removed from the article the statement that Kiev growth was mostly caused by migration from other parts of Ukraine which indeed re-established Ukrainian spirit in the city, which is confirmed, for example, by a relative rise of Ukrainian theater and literature in Kiev at the time. He substituted it by the statement about """"the migration from other parts of the Soviet Union."""" Where does he get this info?The changes he introduced seem ideological rather that relevant and I reverted them once.

For a unary function symbol f, you can substitute a relation symbol R, and interpret it via R(x,y) if and only if f(x)=y.However, there are significant differences between languages that contain function symbols and ones that have only relation symbols.  Function symbols have existential import, in the sense that if you have a structure for a language with a function symbol f, and a closed term t in the language, then the structure must contain an interpretation for f(t).  Relation symbols don't give you that; a structure for a language containing our relation symbol R above is not guaranteed to have an object y such that the structure satisfies R(t,y).This is important for lots of tools used to analyze structures.  For example, the Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé game is usually defined for languages that have only relation and constant symbols.

"e2617aa5e035e857","""Apology accepted, however even if the characterization is accurate for other editors, it serves no purpose in bringing it up.  Making disputes personal rarely enhances dialogue.  Anyway, I think you've concluded basically the same thing I have: such a broadening of definition would include many people who really should not be considered philosophers.  Consider, for instance, Ayn Rand.  She wrote on the topics of metaphysics, ethics, etc, but she did so rhetorically and without actually attempting to prove her points using syllogistic logic.  She contributed nothing to human knowledge, both because her reasoning was fallacious and because any of her actually valid conclusions had already been documented by previous philosophers (for instance, """"objectivist"""" metaphysics are simply a renamed naturalistic metaphysics).  I don't mean to group Dawkins with Rand of course as Dawkins is, in my opinion, a brilliant man who has contributed much to human knowledge.  But this is my point: using such a broadened definition puts Dawkins, Rand, Kant, Mill, and Russel in the same category, which I think is prima facie an incorrect grouping.  Now, as to your point that philosophers will favor their own: well yes, but the same should be said for biologists and physicists.  When we write an article on evolution we value the discoveries of biology and not of religion.  Philosophy is and basically always has been an academic enterprise, starting with the post-religious works of the Sophists/Plato/Aristotle/etc as they founded the world's first philosophical academies.  Since then the practice of philosophy has undergone many manifestations but even among those differences it is generally somewhat easy to tell what is philosophy and what is simply on the subject of philosophy but not actually philosophy.  For instance, the analytical school of philosophy, I think, should not hesitate to consider continental philosophy something other than philosophy, it is just considered to be incorrect (being very general here).  From a Wikipedia standpoint, encyclopedias themselves are an academic enterprise and as such when we're considering how to assign WP:WEIGHT to a subject we do so by reference to experts in that subject.  Whether rightly or wrongly, the experts on philosophy have yet to recognize Dawkins as a philosopher, but as WP editors our job is not to determine whether or not Dawkins is really a philosopher, but rather to consider the expert opinion on the matter and give due weight to minority views when appropriate. talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Some of the worst falsifiers on Wikipedia are Stormie, Lupo, and Matt Crypto. They were challenged to respond to the facts that they suppressed or to concede, and they each conceded that the facts that they suppress are correct and that they delete those facts because they do not want Wikipedia readers to know the truth. They constantly spam their own point of view in their diatribes in which they try to cover up for Nazism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?Many regular writers on Wikipedia are intellectually dishonest  and they regurgitate the top media cover-ups.  They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute.

"e4c9756a92d04df3",""" 1820 Map vs GlobeThe image in the infobox should be a geographic locator as well, showing where the state is within a larger context of the world.It doesn't seem consistent with map of other Chinese dynasty articles (e.g. Ming, Tang, etc). Geographic locator map is mainly used for current country map (not historical map), e.g. People's Republic of China, United States, etc   The Qing Dynasty, although is a dynasty of the past, is also largely a modern political entity, and its history is intertwined with modern world history.  That's why I think a geographic locator is better suited, as it also mirrors the Republic of China (1912-1949) article.  Another thing to consider is that because there are so many contemporaneous maps of the Qing that's available (where as such maps are rare for prior historic dynasties, such as Ming and Tang), it is difficult to choose one that truly represent the whole article in the infobox.  I agree that showing all the different maps of the Qing Dynasty at its various extent and time periods is informative to readers, but they don't have to be in the infobox; a general geographic locator is a good fit there.  Plus, the maps of the Qing Dynasty at 1820 and 1833 are already in the article.   上海\沪\滬\Shanghai I am not going to respond in full at the moment, as I would like to sleep.

(TALK)  Equal Standards TheLeopard, I thank your for your unending quest for the truth, and your campaigning for the integrity of Wikipedia. However, there are other areas of Wikipedia that would greatly profit from similar vigor. Take for instance the previously widely unknown National Capital Region (China). You rescued it from obscurity caused by a redirect. However, it must have escaped you that this article does not contain a single reference, and that there are several claims and outright speculations that deserve at least a dubious tag. A National Capital Region (China) is worthy of the same attention to detail as China’s capital, or other cities such as Shanghai. While it is the job of the author to provide these references (lest the author would risk a deletion), the lack of verifiable sources should at least have been pointed out. I have done so in the meantime. Thank you   The only reason I rescued that article was because it was redirected to Bohai Economic Rim, which clearly is not the same thing as National Capital Region.  The article needs to be tagged with """"unreferenced"""" and a bunch of other tags.   Beijing I know we've had some issues before, but I have to commend you for the Beijing edits.

There's been an Rfd for days nowand I've said that I'd be fine with keeping it, but only if there was a particular reason to.  We are forming guideslines etc, and while a look at the ones in place helped form them, I'll definitely admit that I could have overlooked stuff.  But the current discussion has been going round and round and the person who wants the redirect kept is arguing two things (it seems).  One is that keeping the redirect will prevent article duplication.  And the other is that it will help people find the article.In my point of view, both of these arguments make no sense, as the article in question was moved from name of school plus paramater to name of school plus different parameter.  There are half a dozen different paramaters that could be used easily, so the idea that people are going to naturally gravitate towards the one that did happen to exist and want to create an article there, or search that way doesn't make sense.  If the person really thinks that that's a problem, then they should have created other redirects from the other possible namespaces for the article.  If you could take a look at the discussionI'd appreciate it.  I may be missing something, we may want to change the guidelines per different things that have been raised (notability of the city was raised, which we don't outright address because I didn't think we would need to but we probably should).Alsoit occured to me that there's no WP shortcut for the guideline, which I assume would belong at WP:NC(SCH).

I suppose it’s just possible that it does, and will show up as a new episode at some time, but the makers don’t usually provide any early announcement of new episodes: you just have to watch out for them in the guides to forthcoming programs!I’ve added a grid for the forthcoming “Santa’s Grotto” DVD (release date 25 October 2010 according to all the main sellers of such items), allowing 10 lines for the episode list as the cover shown says “Features 10 fun packed piggy tales”. Also, following what seems to be usual practice, I’ve assumed that the first episode on the DVD will be titled “Santa’s Grotto”, though we don’t know yet when it will be first be shown on TV. We can fill the rest in when we know exactly what episodes are to be included, and their order. Presumably any new episodes being included on the DVD will be first broadcast prior to the DVD release date?       “Digiguide” is indicating that there are two new episodes (“Freddy Fox” and “Whistling”) showing on Five on the 24th September at 8.15 a.m. and 8.25 a.m., presumably to be followed on later (weekdays?) by further new episodes.

I can reference 40 articles in a day, 1/3 of the 124 proposed, this is very doable folks.I would strongly encouarge you to support this proposal. It is very doable. I am actively working to notify other wikiprojects of several tools, see for example:User_talk:The-Pope#Your_idea_at_Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment.2FBiographies_of_living_people As User:The-Pope wrote on my talk page:The WP:Australia project had a list of over 2000 names just over 2 weeks ago.

I conducted harassment and interdiction fire. I used 50 calibre machine guns, which we were granted and ordered to use, which were our only weapon against people. I took part in search and destroy missions, in the burning of villages.  All of this is contrary to the laws of warfare, all of this is contrary to the Geneva Conventions and all of this is ordered as a matter of written established policy by the government of the United States from the top down. And I believe that the men who designed these, the men who designed the free fire zone, the men who ordered us, the men who signed off the air raid strike areas, I think these men, by the letter of the law, the same letter of the law that tried Lieutenant Calley, are war criminals.   Those sorts of things took place, and were documented as taking place - and in fact were mostly SOP. Even SBVT member William Garlow found  Hoffmann's tactics distasteful . French is not being truthful, or is at best being disingenuous if he simply doesn't think these things should be referred to as """"atrocities,"""" a term that Kerry was quite clear in qualifying. And compare French's description of Kerry's """"mutiny"""" remark with what he actually said: The fact of the matter is that the members of Coastal Division 11 and Coastal Division 13 when I was in Vietnam were fighting the policy very, very hard, to the point that many of the members were refusing to carry out orders on some of their missions; to the point where the crews started to in fact mutiny, say, """"I would not go back on the rivers again"""" ... A little different from claiming that he said """"crews at An Thoi were involved in amutiny,"""" isn't it?  We know for a fact that there was plenty of disgruntlement over SEALORDS policies (read Brinkley, for instance), and officers did refuse to carry out some of Hoffmann's orders .  Is Al French prepared to say no crewmembers ever refused to go back up certain rivers or on particularly foolhardy missions?  We know for a fact the lack of air support was so bad that RF/PF forces  refused to go on patrols without helicopter support.   French is knocking down his own strawman.I think there's plenty to question in the other affidavits, especially Elliott's and Letson's, but again, I have no problem including them alongside all the other interviews and accountings in the reference section.

Indeed, this concept is quite blur if we refer to the numerous pages from different Microsoft web sites.For instance, at http://www.microsoft.com/technet/windowsserver/evaluate/features/compare.mspx, we can find:Windows 2003 Server Standard x64 R2 (64 bits):- 4-way symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) supportOther example for the same Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard x64 Edition at http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/64bit/x64/standard.mspx- memory-bound applications that do not require more than four processors.- supports up to 32 GB of RAM on 1- to 4-way servers.- Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard x64 Edition supports up to four CPUs on one server)If we refer to Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing, multiprocessor architecture or multicore processor are both SMP architecture. Thus, by speaking sometimes about 4 processors support, sometimes about 4-way SMP support, Microsoft confuses us all.Coming to a Quadri 4-cores based server (16 SMP), this leads to go from a Standard edition (4 processors support) to a DataCenter edition (4x4=16 SMP support), thus raising the license price as for no less than +700%.",0,0,0,0,0,0

This epithet refers to the legend of a Mauian prince who was banished to Lānaʻi for some of his wild pranks at his father's court in Lāhainā. The island was haunted by Akua-ino, ghosts, and goblins. Kauluāʻau chased them away and brought about peace and order on the island, and was in consequence restored to the favor of his father.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

"5f59ac13c49b269a","""There is a difference between Pink Floyd the band (which this page is about) and Pink Floyd the corporation. As Far as Pink Floyd the band is concerned, Roger Waters has not been a member since 1985. A member of a band is someone who plays in the band. Further, Roger Waters has no rights to any of the new music/albums that have come out since he left. i.e. Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell. Once again showing that he is no longer a member. Finally, Pink Floyd does not need permission from Roger Waters to release albums such as Pulse. He does get paid royalties, but that is it. Further, I fail to see how you could list """"The estate of Richard Wright"""" as a member of a band. Does the estate play the piano? No. It receives royalties for sure, but that doesn't make it a band member, it makes it a corporate member. I agree with Radiopathy that they should all be listed under former members. This is inline with the template on Wikipedia for musical artists. I would challenge anyone to find a Wikipedia page on a band that lists members who are no longer active as """"members"""" and not """"former members"""". I would also challenge you to find a band (other than the beatles, which I agree I don't like that format) that is inactive that doesn't list it's members as """"former members"""". Perhaps a good comparison would be the band Genesis. On their page only Phil Collins, Tony Banks, and and Mike Rutherford are listed, even though Peter Gabriel still own rights to aspects of the band like Roger Waters does to Pink Floyd. Also, INXS does not list Michael Hutchence as a member. Why? Because he's deceased, as it clearly states on the page. I'm sure his estate receives royalty payments. I would argue that the problem we are having is that some folks are simply unwilling to acknowledge the fact that Pink Floyd exists without Roger Waters, but I could be wrong. What's frustrating is to see that this article, which was once a featured article, deviates from the norm in more than one respect in regards to this section. 1 - it lists current members of a band that is inactive (I'd be willing to have that discussion), and 2 - even if we determine that the band is active, it lists a member who is no longer playing witht the band, and a member who is deceased.

""""Skorecki reported that Pinchas the zealot mentioned in the Bible may be the origin of J2"""" This is a very important information that confirms matematical, historic, and genealogy facts. Phinchas was the son of Eleazar. Itamar was his brother. Out of the 24 Cohanim houses, 16 did belong to Eleazar-Pinchas, while only 8 came out from Itamar seed. Eleazar-Pinchas (J2) had a much larger population than Itamar. All Cohanim genealogy were divided into those two houses, until the destruction of the second temple. So, if Phinchas is the origin of all Cohanim J2, than it makes sense, since his Cohanim seed produced much more descendants than his brother Itamar. So, it is very normal and logical to understand why genetic cohanim signatures presents two CMHs wich is the caracteristics of the two houses of Cohanim. All genealogic tree for Cohanim since Aaron until today are still divided into these two houses: Eleazar-Pinchas and Itamar. During the 1270 years of the cohanim services (Mishkan and Mikdash) the Cohanim jews were always selected by the 24 houses. 18 from Pinchas, and only 8 from Itamar. That´s why J2 Cohanim is almost twice as common than J1 Cohanim"""" —Preceding unsigned comment added by 189.27.127.148   WHAAAAT{During the 1270 years of the cohanim services (Mishkan and Mikdash) the Cohanim jews were always selected by the 24 houses. 18 from Pinchas, and only 8 from Itamar.

Dr. Karl Skorecki of the Ramban/Technion Medical Center in Haifa, who is renowned for his discovery in 1997 of the Kohen genetic signature, reported in 2007 that he and his research team have discovered not one but two Cohen Modal Haplotypes, which he called J1 and J2. """"Pinchas, the zealot mentioned in the Bible, may be the origin of J2"""" he suggested. The extended CMH-12 is established for J1 Cohanim only. If somebody in J1 also has CMH-12, then he is likely to have Cohen ancestry. J1 Cohanim form a tight network around CMH-12. But this is not the case for J2. The CMH-12 does not apply to J2. If a J2 is in CMH-12, it tells us nothing about one being a Cohen. In J2, the CMH-12 has no special status. The J1 lineage of Cohanim in CMH-12 could be much more recent.  Jewish Cohanim in J2 form a much larger network around CMH-6  than Jewish Cohanim in J1 do. Cohanim Jews belong mainly to haplogroup J2 because Cohanim as a group (J1,J2) have a high frequency of J2. The J2 Cohanim have much more ancient common ancestor, according to the *observed* mutation rate (which is three times faster than the standard, """"effective"""" rate). J2 Cohanim serves as the deep background of the priestly Jewish caste (J1,J2). “The finding of J2 among contemporary Cohanim can lend credence that today’s Cohanim (J1,J2) may be descendents of two different founding dynasties – including coalescence to Phinchas as the founder of J2 Cohanim” concluded Dr. Karl Skorecki.Why the confirmation that Phinchas may be the orign of J2 Cohanim is so important?“Pinchas, son of Elazar, son of Aharon the Kohen turned back My anger from upon the Children of Yisrael, so I did not destroy the Children of Yisrael. Therefore say - behold, I give to him My covenant of peace” (Numbers 25:10 - 30:1). “God gave to Pinchas a new permanent priesthood, for him and his descendants for all generations.” (Zohar HaKadosh 3:124a). God indicated that Phinchas had acted justly by rewarding him with the most counter-intuitive form of blessing - an all-new form of priesthood. He is given the Divine Covenant of Peace and the gift of eternal priesthood. Zadok, a des",0,0,0,0,0,0

"9e80ca14ba197367","Are you even listening to me? In 1838, the Armenian Oblast (Armenian province) population was numbering of about 165,000 people according to statistics, about half were Armenian(excluding the later 200,000 on its seroundings who later immigrated). In 1924 the population of Azerbaijan was of 2 million, 75% were Azeri Tartars, it compromised of Baku province , Elizavetpol Province and the adjoining districts, (including Nagorno Karabakh and Nakhochevan). From 250-300,000 Armenians were moved from Julfa, Erivan and Nakhichevan in 1604 and following, if you claim that there was even as much Muslim there, you are totally ignoring the history of the period. Since the partial control by the Ottoman, Nakhichevan and Erivan served as depots of goods, intermedary from the Ouest and East, Persia even further pushed that but replaced the Armenians who would rather trade on the Shah's capital. You claim having provided data, but you have provided absolutly nothing, because the only things you have provided, even before I covered them, and what you present in no way contradict what you claim. A projection of that much people (250-300,000), to claim that Tartars at least presented that much in the Western zone, would have been just sensless.What I have provided.1-That there were reasons specifically targetting Armenians which do not apply and were not applied to Muslims.2-I have provided materials excluding the Muslims in reference to the depopulation.3-I have provided materials equating the population with the word Armenian.4-I have provided a reference prior to Gultestan Treaty, and you dismissed the author, while in Wikipedia we only present sources and if there exist critics from notable published materials of those sources. What you think of the author is original research.You answered by presenting 13-14th century and post Gulestan materials, which in no way have I contested nor do they contradict what I have been saying. I have provided figures of Armenian moved, which by projection represent 2 million or more Armenians if projected for 1918, and those excludes the recorded numbers of Armenians who escaped depopulation and inspite of it, there still remained a considerable number of Armenians pre Gulestan, which I also documented. I have documented everything I have been claiming, you request things that do not exist, because there was no Nakhochevan delimitation in that period, nor statistics for a bordering which is quite modern in comparaison to Abbas period.In short, what you have highlighted is that the word Armenian has no place in this article, and that you have no intention to improve it. You know that what you propose is misleading but you still claim it is neutral. As we speak 98% of Nakhichevan population is Azeri, so claiming depopulation could only be misleading in that it suggest that Azeris were those moved when the Armenians were those mostly affected. Obviously here, we do have a problem, and as it appears, you in no way want to correct it.  (ix)",0,0,0,0,0,0

"7ebd8162d07c807a","Could you explain what explanation you think is missing from this article?  There are extensive wikilinks to articles on the details of the science, as you know.  TS @Tony: Links are generally bad when it is possible to give an explanation in the body of the article.  Any science article should give a clear and coherent and succinct explanation of why scientists believe x.   In this case (correct me if I'm wrong), the reasons why scientists believe the global warming hypothesis (namely the hypothesis that the earth is continuing to warm, and that the increase in temperature in the last 100 years is not merely a random accident) are Empirical evidence: The temperature record, which suggests that the increase is not merely a random accident.   Theoretical model: Radiative forcing by anthropogenically introduced factors (CO2, mainly) Theoretical model: FeedbackAs to what is missing. There is no explanation in the article about the statistics of temperature records, nor about the need (very important in science) to distinguish random fluctuations from changes caused by an underlying process. For example, current economic theory, the Efficient Market Hypothesis holds that there are no such things as trends in stock markets - the 'trends' you see are just the result of humans trying to see patterns in events that are essentially random.  A lot of that theory involves careful definition of randomness, and types of randomness.  I don't see an equivalent section in this article. The explanation in the article of radiative forcing is somewhat better, but goes into unnecessary detail - the section on Greenhouse gases can't decide whether it is about the increase in CO2, or the effect of that increase.  The stuff on aerosols and soot tends to confuse the whole thing - that should be left to a sub-article. The role of feedback is hardly explained at all.  That (I believe) is an important part of the hypothesis, yet the section discussing it is a strange list of things with no obvious purpose.   There is no heading section that ties the three parts of the hypothesis together.The section 'climate models' is all rather uncertain.  It needs a summary at the beginning to explain what scientists conclude from their use of models, and perhaps some material on the uncertainty that is attached to models.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Something like:Props  Dean Greyling (NT)  Rayno Gerber (SR)  Rossouw de Klerk (CC)  Basil Short (VC)Hooker  Chiliboy Ralepelle (NT)(NT) Represented South Africa in 2012(SR) Represented the  in Super Rugby in 2012(CC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Currie Cup rugby in 2012(VC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Vodacom Cup rugby in 2012The indicator would show the highest level the player played at during the season and players would be sorted by position first, then this indicator, then surname.However, an alternate representation could be: PropsNameNTSRCCVC  Dean Greyling                          Rayno Gerber                                      Rossouw de Klerk                                  Basil Short                                                 Hookers  Chiliboy Ralepelle                   (NT) Represented South Africa in 2012(SR) Represented the  in Super Rugby in 2012(CC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Currie Cup rugby in 2012(VC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Vodacom Cup rugby in 2012This could again be sorted by playing position, then level played, then surname.  Footnotes can be used if a player represented a different Super Rugby franchise than the main one affiliated with the union, etc. A template (which is a slight variation on {{rugby squad player}}) can be developed to simplify this.Any thoughts, question, comments, suggestions, criticisms, etc?""",0,0,0,0,0,0

It's understandable that you didn't know of any active projects connected to WP:CVG when you made your proposal - It's not as if any of us are being paid to be here, are we? Now that I know why we weren't told, I don't have a problem with that part.I'll read over the current proposal sometime today. I didn't respond to your comments at WP:MK because the previous discussion of the MK template split (which I was involved in) raised issues brought up in your proposal (that's how we were told). I believe that the main concern we had was over the ease of navigation, so the changes were reverted. I still have the same concerns about your proposal. Other WP:MK members may still share this opinion, have other issues, or are not bothered. That's why I've asked you to discuss your plans for the MK template with (the rest of) us before you proceed.Personally, I agree with the aesthetic changes you're proposing, but I disagree with the severe limit on links in the template. The characters article you linked to was a good start, but it does no harm to link to some more categories that are related to the series, if only to make navigation more convenient. That's all that I'm prepared to say while I'm half-asleep, but if you have any more questions for me personally, I'll respond when I'm able to.  07:16",0,0,0,0,0,0

"ea56f91e5c6aa89a","This is the armeniapedia version about the battleIn violation of the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty with soviet Russia, Turkish troops crossed the border in 1918 and attacked Alexandropol (Leninakan). The aggressor intended to crush Eastern Armenia and seize Transccaucasia. When Alexandropol fell, the Turkish Army poured into the Ararat Valley – the heart of Armenia. There was a major engagement at Sardarabad on May 22-26, where the Turkish Army was defeated and retreated.  First of all I do not know how to revert. I just make changes. Second as I am trying to put this version, a very good guy, named roob323 reverts to an older Turkish version of the site. Moreover, now it sounds even ridiculous.The same thing they wrote twice. Just by cutting and pasting from the history of the article. These kids who never went to school in Armenia, whose knowledge about Armenian history comes from church sunday schools write things that can couse laugh even in Turkish readers. For example, in early May recently becamed independent Armenia was attacked by Ottoman forces ( Armenia Georgia and Azerbaijan decalred their independence only in the end of May). Or, after losing the battle of Sardarapat, Armenia declared its independence (second time as a matter of fact). But we all know that the second time Armenia declared its Sovetization (occupation by bolsheviks) on November 29,1920 and not independence. It is very well known that the commander in the battle of Sardarapat was Daniel Bek Pirumov from the village of Nakhichevanik in Nagorno Karabakh. SO fat these 2 imbeciles named Nareklm and roob keep pushing the name Slkuni or Silician.  And finall,y who needs the aftermath of the battle in Sardarapat if it concludes information about what Georgia did, who it asked for help etc etc etc. I am surprized to find out from the article edited by roob and narek that Turkish army occupied the whole Armenia(including Russian part which is todays Armenia). Probably Nagorno Karabakh or Zangezur or Sevan they do not consider a part of Armenia anymore. Moreover, in the history of this article also edited by some turks and Narek you can find out that Armenia was forced to sign treaty of Batumi!!!!!You can see how come 3 not literate (angraget in Armenian) imbeciles can come and do things in wikipedia that Turkish and Azeri propagandists could not even see in their dreams. Because these 3 imbeciles have got a right to revert edit or even block others, the real Armenian history specialists can get heart attacks if they read this article.

She said in many cases people were detained simply for being alleged members of groups that do not like Americans.  Green quoted extensively from the tribunal proceeding against Mustafa Ait Idir, 34, an Algerian living in Bosnia who was accused of plotting with others to blow up a U.S. embassy there. Idir noted that a Bosnian court found no evidence against him and repeatedly but unsuccessfully asked tribunal officials to present their evidence that he was an al Qaeda fighter. He argued he could not prove a negative, and that he would hit a person who claimed he was a terrorist in the face, which prompted the tribunal members to laugh.

Scientists or journalists in unrelated fields would naturally feel the need to urge appropriate tools of science or journalism, so as to avoid the kind of mistakes that have plagued human civilizations since the dawn of recorded history.Urging people to examine the evidence for (or against) some theory with a skeptical eye is simply sound advice, regardless of the subject.

It's not considered accepted by the vast majority of sources (including ITIS, which I think is our standard). Besides, the taxonomy of the species is simply too volatile to be moving it around.

Secondly, except for freeware games like Battle for Wesnoth and Galaxy Mage, I don't see a lot of evidence of Western TRPGs being inspired by Japanese games. When developers do mention their inspiration, they tend to cite X-COM, Jagged Alliance or Fallout. The origin of X-COM dates back to Rebelstar and Laser Squad, earlier games by the same developer that predate the Japanese TRPGs.

"2bf58d9f5120ce10","""FGR#11 is interesting and gives some insight into how this bureaucratic world functions. A couple of things I noted. The table of p28 shows a good dozen elements (including Ca) where the values changes by well over and order of magnitude from on """"model"""" to the next. The following summary on p29  says: """"for about 70% of radionuclides, the differences are not substantial, ie., less than a factor of four. That points out that none of these figures are derived from actual physical measurements but from computer models. Also there is no qualification on the uncertainty of these values as one would expect if it was a scientific test (which it is not , it's a model) . The magnitude of the changes and that fact that a factor of 4 is seen as """"not substantial"""" gives an idea of how reliable the number may or may not be. http://health.phys.iit.edu/extended_archive/9503/msg00092.htmlI don't know what the exchange rate for K is, but it is prsesent in signif-icant amounts in the urine, at concentrations that vary comparatively widely.This would suggest, I suppose, that the body regulates K very closely, disposingof excess amounts very rapidly.

"64cdf27c1472e842","""The reason the PS2 lacks AA is because AA requires processing power. If the PS2 were to attempt to render any of it's higher-end games with added AA, it's framerate would keel over and die. I further believe you have no idea what you are talking about because you claim AA does not make digitally rendered images look better. The following chart is borrowed from the AA's wikipedia page.(a)(b)(c)Figure 1(a) is no AA, (b) is with AA, and (c) is with a different AA. If you honestly believe (b) or (c) are in some way """"blurry"""", then I agree you are entitled to your own opinion. If you do not find (b) and (c) to be blurry at all, but less Jagged, then you realize the importance of this effect. You would then realize that AA does not cause your video quality to be blurry, but it is more likely that your TV is causing the blurryness. I know this because TVs are already too blurry for my personal preference. The PS2 does not actually need AA. It is not ment for use with an HD TV. However, if you were to use a PS2 with an HD TV, you would realize the presence of massive jaggies in comparison to the xbox's picture quality. Just incase you did not know, you compare screenshots by seeing how they would look on the highest quality screen, prefferedly the same screen unit. You do not compare them by putting them on an old tv from the 1980s. A 1980s TV would make the PS2's graphics look far more competitive with the xbox's graphics. However, an HD TV would not. I have not  made any false statements as far as I know. I assume that was directed at the AA bust. The reason I said the PS2 lacked AA is not because it could not do it, but because it does not do it. That last statement is sort of like saying a low end Dell computer is more powerful than a super computer because it has sold 100x as many units. This is not about grabbing ilrelevent facts such as sales to divert the fact that you're wrong and can't prove otherwise, this is about how the xbox is more powerful than the PS2 and the screenshots are clear evidence. """"I never said PS2 is more powerful."""" is what you said. """"Xbox is not more powerful then PS2"""" is the arguement. The architectures being different does not make it unfair to compare them. You can easily compare them with performance tests. The xbox excels farther at it's target goal than the PS2, therefor it is more powerful. Is there an arguement to that? Does the PS2's 6.2 GFLOPS (relative to the xbox's 2.9 GFLOPS) suddenly make the PS2 more powerful? Does a meaningless benchmark magicly make the PS2 better at doing something that the xbox is actually better at doing? No it does not. The xbox consistantly exhibits better performance, therefor it is nothing but logical to say it is more powerful.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"7b61990ababb03d4","Dating the exoudus I added this over in the book of Joshua section and it has relavence here:There is now a theory postulated by Dr. Gerald E. Aardsma and Dr. Emmanuel Anati that states the occupation of Palestine by the Israelites occurred prior to the late Bronze Age as had been originally theorized. Doctors Aardsma and Anati say they have found evidence to support Joshua’s conquest occurring in the early Bronze Age at around 2200-2500 B.C. They state that both a settlement bearing topographical similarity to the biblical city of “Ai” and the city of Jericho were destroyed in this time frame and that both sites had defensive walls at this time. In addition, it was found the city of “Ai” was burned to the ground at this time, which fits the events in the Book of Joshua. Furthermore, it has been found that at this time the previous inhabitants of the areas around these cities gave way to a more nomadic people with different types of pottery than the original inhabitants and which developed into a pastoral society dominated by small villages. All of this would more accurately reflect what was recorded in the Biblical accounts of Joshua’s invasion, but it also conflicts with some of the Bible’s Old Testament chronology. Dr. Aardsma argues the Old Testament chronology must be an incorrect recording of the original chronological information.This argument has a profound effect on dating the exodus since it would mean the Israelites would have left for Palestine just after the end of the Egyptian Old Kingdom, maybe even during its downfall. It would also push the age of the patriarchs back to about 2800-3000 B.C. which would mean any evidence of Joseph would need to be found in the Early Dynastic Period.

"662d66e37bc5e941",""":43, 15 January 2010 (UTC)I disagree with the analysis of John Z. Remember, in 1967 Israel agreed to UN Resolution 242 while Arab states rejected it... I think it is futile to draw conclusions about the outcome of the war based on what different leaders of Egypt and Israel agreed to at different times, if only because these decisions have as much to do with domestic and global situations as with the bi-lateral and regional conflict itself. In case of Sadat's peace initiative, the Israeli postion was also largely determined by the style in which it was presented. But, again, I agree with you completely that one-word interpretations have no place in the infobox or lead, and arguably, in the article. Instead, arguments from different sources and on different aspects need to be all presented and contrasted. No conclusion is warranted.   That simply isn't true about SC 242, though it is a common misapprehension.  See our article (or more comprehensible, less battleground-like old versions). Egypt and Jordan immediately accepted SC 242, while Israel neither accepted nor rejected it. During 1968 it at first privately to the UN Secretary General, and later publicly, gradually accepted SC242. A clear Israeli public acceptance including the word """"withdrawal"""" was not made until August 1970 as part of the Israeli-Egyptian-Jordanian acceptance of the Rogers B plan; it was controversial enough to induce Begin to resign from the cabinet.  See Shlaim's Iron Wall, p. 260 & p. 296.  Yet again; this complex issue needs to be properly explored within the article body. I think that certain strategic benefits were seen by Israel (along with some drawbacks, as noted - mostly prompting renewed negotiation). Israel successfully defended itself, and held off joint armies again - this has probably prevented additional military adventures against Israel.Constantly """"grandstanding"""" in the infobox is a futile exercise, editors should use their energies more effectively by creating a comprehensive explanation.   This User Talk Page message concerns me. First, it accuses me of POV-pushing when I was reverting POV-pushing by an editor who has been changing a number of conflict infoboxes to """"Israeli Victory"""".

"7b65d0ef1b27c725",", 23 August 2013 (UTC)Here's what I find interesting about this thread. The structure of Wikipedia enables anyone to edit and source articles.  So, if someone feels something is missing from an article, they are free to edit in and source what they believe is missing.  Then, of course, their own edits are open to a challenge.  All I've seen here, and elsewhere are complaints and tagging about POV.  After a while, this is repetitive and just not productive. And of course, none of us work for anyone else at Wikipedia, no one gets to boss anyone around or intimidate anyone into writing for them.  No one here can force anyone else here to obey their will. If you have the courage of your convictions, write it and source it . Put up or shut up.  11:21",0,0,0,0,0,0

Everyone who posts in Wikipedia is a real person; we use log-in identities to protect our privacy and our private identities.  If someone uses his or her real name in Wikipedia, it is published in this version of Wikipedia and all over the internet.

Although I have continually posted my concerns in good faith, I have been continually set upon as if I have not.  I assure you that since first contributing to Wikipedia as """"NYScholar"""" in June 2005, I have done my best to learn about and to follow Wikipedia's obviously-convoluted and often contradictory editing policies and guidelines, which are frequently edited and changed by those editing Wikipedia, and often vandalized.  I have done my best to contribute to Wikipedia in good faith and yet be forced (demanded) to respond to in my own view entirely-unfounded and false charges that I have not been editing in good faith.

I was trying to find an image for Tropical Depression One in 1988, when I came across this, which looks like a well-organized unclassified storm just off of North Carolina. On May 26 a cold front extended across the western Atlantic Ocean. The next day, a circulation developed to the southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, with much of its convection sheared to the northeast; at the time, it might have still been frontal. Tracking to the northeast, by early the next day the center became more involved with the convection, though only based on interpolation from IR. By the time of the first visible image, it was just off of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, possibly extratropical or subtropical, based on the (presumably) cold air being entrained. Convection deepened, and three hours later it looked tropical, which is where I found the image. Unfortunately, there's no more Atlantic visible images after that due to an error. Nilfanion found this visible satellite image, meaning it must not have been very deep. Here's another, and here's a small one. Verdict?

I find his decision unfortunate, but that is his own choice. As for Moldova, thanks for your offer of help. The article is in a rather sorry state, and I always had it at the top of my list but never quite got around to it. Indeed, there is much work to be done. I am trying to make the article follow the guidelines listed on Wikipedia:WikiProject Countries. As my model, I have other featured articles on countries, such as Belgium, Turkey, and Germany. The problem is that now there is little structure to the Moldova article and much random (and some inaccurate) information. Of course, if there is relevant data, I don't want it lost, so if it's just too detailed for the main article, it should be moved to the sub-articles. My idea for a schedule was to first create the skeleton of the article, meaning that only the sections from the Countries projects should be kept and rest integrated or moved. Then, all the sections need to be reworked, some to be expanded, others made more compact, others need sources (and most existing sources need to be changed to standard formats). Then, various issues of style need to be changed (i.e. to make the article pretty), which means finding some nice images, making the tables look nicer, etc. And finally, the article will need to be copy-edited and checked for errors.

Despite 's statement, you have not so far been reported at WP:Administrator intervention against vandalism as far as I can see; but if you continue your disruptive editing you will be. Looking at your edits, I get that you have strong opinions about John de Ruiter. While I know nothing of him, I have some sympathy with your position. But you are going about your campaign in a way that is disruptive to Wikipedia, and you need to stop.First, as you have already been told, you introduced material (and, in particular, critical material) into a biography of a living person without giving any references to a published source which supports your material. This is absolutely forbidden, but the first time you did it our policy of assuming good faith should lead any other editor to just remove your additions and explain to you that this is not acceptable; and this is what happened.What you are encouraged to do at that point, is to discuss the matter on the talk page Talk:John de Ruiter, and try to reach agreement with other editors; if you are unable to do so, our dispute resolution procedure would tell you how to proceed.What you did do, is to insert your unsupported material again. This is called edit warring, and is a quick way to get yourself blocked from Wikipedia.Assuming that you are in good faith (i.e. that you think the de Ruiter article is unbalanced), your best bet is to start by finding some reliable published sources which are critical of him (not blogs or forums, but material from reputable publishers). If you can find some, then you may edit the article to add only what is supported by the sources you have found (though in view of your recent history, even in this case you should probably start by discussing it on the talk page). If you cannot find such sources, then I'm afraid you must not edit the page further. Unsupported material and original research are not permitted in Wikipedia articles.I suspect that you believe that it is important to expose something you think is not right about how de Ruiter presents himself. If that is that case, I'm afraid that Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and you may not use it in that way.",0,0,0,0,0,0

In the early 80s it was in an annex to the Prado and then was moved to the Reina Sofia, no?)   | Talk 07:32, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)Duh, yeah that is what I meant to say. It has been 4 years since I was there.  Yes, I would think someone could find a source for that being a common anecdote. -  13:32, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)The most specific version I could find as that Picasso is supposed to have said this in 1937, replying to German ambassador Otto Abetz, as he was visiting Picasso's studio. Then there are versions that have Picasso handing out postcards (sometimes autographed, even) to Germans while making this quip, but the most popular is probably the one that uses an anonymous German officer bringing/seeing a postcard/photograph. None of these sites mention sources, of course, but this one has an interesting addition:Picasso himself probably had contributed to Barr's and others' perception of him having behaved rather boldly throughout the war when, immediately following the liberation, he told an American correspondent for Newsweek magazine that on the day when a German army officer had recognized a sketch of Guernica pinned to the wall of his studio and had asked him, """"Did you do that?,"""" Picasso coldly had replied, """"No, you did."""" Now the tale originates with Picasso himself and is told to Newsweek, which makes this version much more credible than the others, since it's hard to see how a response to Abetz or a group of officers would not be better documented, while it's equally hard to see how a reply to a single anonymous German officer could be known at all. Unfortunately, no other site corroborates the Newsweek detail. I've sent a mail to the Newsweek editors and I'll keep you posted. If someone could check out some Picasso biographies to check whether they mention the anecdote (and what source they give, if any), that would be great.  13:14, 2005 Apr 25 (UTC) We can certainly cite the fact that Picasso himself told a (possibly apocryphal) story. It makes the line his, even if it's not clear he really said it in the claimed circumstances.   | Talk 16:05, Apr 26, 2005 (UTC) Yes, if Picasso really told it. So far, no sources are backing up that website (or even just repeating that version), so I'm not too keen on it. Otherwise the whole thing is just as apocryphal as before.  · Talk 16:46, 2005 Apr 26 (UTC) If anyone is up for some library work: old Newsweeks are pretty easy to find.   | Talk 06:31, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC) Nudity? I reverted this from Category:Paintings containing nudity to Category:Paintings. Clearly, the fact that one naked female human breast is visible in the painting is a very minor fact about the painting; no one by a very weird obsessive would look for it there. It is primarily a political work about war. I could make a case that it is a perfect illustration that nakedness is not always nudity, but I think it suffices to say",0,0,0,0,0,0

That's why we got a Wolverine movie and not a Cyclops movie, or a Rogue movie, or a Storm movie...or anyone else for that matter. Yeah, according to McG, J.

It had a classic wood and leather interior including walnut picnic tables recessed into the backs of the front seats, and the different frontal treatment you can see hints of in the pic. The VP was something of a freak - who was it aimed at in marketing terms and did anyone ever associate Allegros with luxury motoring? It was probably produced because Ford was having big success with the Ghia versions of some of its models, upgraded and laden with extras for which a premium price was charged, and cash-strapped BL was desperate for some of the action. The reason for raising this is that VPs weren't actually badged as Austins (or Allegros for that matter), but sold as a separate marque albeit through the same BL dealderships,so the pic shouldn't appear on the Austin history page cos it isn't.

"31a8abc0f30d0587","Having looked more closely at the initial references you linked me to (before even glancing at the latest ones) I now realize that they are multiple and all say the same thing, so I've redacted what I had originally said about it possibly being a typo - one or two typos are possible, consistently being wrong multiple times is not.  All I can state is that the novel has Elphinstone as the rank I stated, but quite possibly that was a literary tweak in order to make Christian the only Master's Mate. I'm certainly not going to claim the fictional variant is correct and all the non-fictional versions are wrong! Now that I look at Elphinstone's and Churchill's ages, Elphinstone (at 36) is 8 years older than Churchill (at 28) so it is unlikely, but by no means impossible, that Elphinstone was junior in rank to Churchill.  To be honest, I'm a bit confused why there would be 2 Master's Mates on the same ship with so small a crew - is that normal?  That would make it the only rank on the Bounty for which there was more than one instance other than quartermaster (and of course, able seaman!).  Anyway, I don't want to get stuck on this issue - I had asked who you the other Master's Mate was and you told me. My response to your reply is now a bit of a digression, but hopefully an informative one. Let's move on. Granted that Elphinstone is indeed a Master's Mate, the number of crew not berthed in the forecastle in point (5) below is now 15 not 14, which is still greater than 13. 66.16.144.18",0,0,0,0,0,0

"04c231ddb0a06522","A consistent conceptualization of phylogenies Phylogenies (i.e., dictomously branching processes) are processes that involve things, that is, objects, and as such have to be modeled by Object-Oriented Modeling in order to be consistent with the distinction of objects. Darwins model of evolution illustrates biological species as objects, and is thus no different from phylogenies of other kinds of objects (like asexually reproducing cells or mitochondria). Now, as an Object-Oriented Model, the model actually represents two consecutive objects (i.e., two objects in a row) by each of its internal lines (i.e., lines between nodes): one after a node and one before a node; the former belonging to the category (i.e., concept) 'objects after nodes' and the latter to the category 'objects before nodes'. If the model includes all objects of a certain category, then both of these make up this category. In summary: phylogenies consist of two categories (i.e., concepts) of objects: objects before nodes and objects after nodes, and if the phylogeny includes all things of a category, then these two categories make up this category.(Cladistics, or cladism as I prefer to call it, confuses the concept 'objects after nodes' with the concept 'objects before nodes' by defining lines between nodes as single things, thereby confusing category with object, that is kind with thing, thus confusing conceptualization itself. The approach is actually a return to a pre-scientific stage, this time denying the incompatibility between pattern and process instead of acknowledging it and solving it consistently. It is a return alley that no scientist had ever expected anyone to advocate. If this approach could ever be proved to be correct, then it would mean that reality only exists in our own heads. Luckily, Einstein's discovery that time is relative to space falsifies the approach (i.e., claim), and this it did even before the approach was born. Cladism was thus shown to be wrong before it emerged). Consist (presently at 83.254.20.53  )",0,0,0,0,0,0

The station's official format is Classic Rock, not Rock, Album Oriented Rock and not Active Rock. I received this response from users who will not allow me to edit the content myself:""""I talked with that other user and he said since WACL """"makes no clear distinction in its marketing (and based on the station website and group website, it doesn't) either rely on the Arbitron listing (which is derived from the station's own reporting)"""" it should fall under the Rock label.

During that time, the station would carry a country music format, branded as """"Z-98"""".On March 7, 1997, the format was changed to classic rock, branded as """"Cool 98.5"""". To accommodate this, the callsign was changed to WACL. On May 2, 2001 at midnight, WACL changed their branding to """"98 Rock"""". On April 1, 2008, WACL began carrying the syndicated radio program Nights with Alice Cooper, when it moved from WBHB-FM at 105.1 FM (now WTGD) to WACL-FM at 98.5 FM when the format had been switched to classic country.MusicWACL plays a blend of Classic Rock and Active Rock.The current content is completely inaccurate and non-verifiable.

The claims she makes above lack credibility. The link to Williams' own web site simply contains more of her unfounded rantings. Williams seems to understand so little about Wikipedia that she does not understand that Andrea James is NOT the author of the Wikipedia biography about her. The information about the colleges  Andrea James has attended and her degrees from them are well known and easily verified facts. The other facts in the Andrea James biography are also easily verified. There is no requirement that Andrea James provide documentation about the biography of her to Wikipedia editors. If Ms. Williams were at all credible, it would be her responsibility to produce notarized letters from Wabash College and the University of Chicago that Ms. James did not receive degrees from them. Ms. James is a well known author, film maker, and activist whose laudable efforts are well documented. Ms. James activities are also well documented by national magazines, newspapers, and television appearances. Ms. Williams has no such credibility. The evidence is clear, from Ms. Williams infantile response above, and her infantile behavior on Wikipedia and elsewhere on the internet that her beliefs are the product of some form of delusion on her part.

Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable.

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion. To do this, add  on the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies.

KHAN'S PICTURE SHOULD BE THE LAST TO BE DELETED. -srry for the caps, just wanted attention.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)   death I think there are various explanations on how chinggis died in the different sources. Some say he fell from a horse, others allege a connection to a XiXia princess, one(?) goes into detail and sais that this princess severed the small Genghis. I think incorporating this into the article would be better than leaving it at the current """"unknown reasons"""". I'll try to find the exact citations until tomorrow. Heissig's Ein Volk sucht seine Geschichte should be OK, I assume?    Spelling of name The article says:""""Genghis"""" as popularly spelled and pronounced in Western media and text is supposedly derived from the original Persian reports of an invading army, led by a man in 1219 against the Khwarezmid Empire. The Persian people pronounced the man's name """"Genghis"""", as there was no """"ch"""" sound in the Persian tongue. Henceforth, the Persian version of the name of the leader of the Mongol Empire became known and widespread in the Western hemisphere as """"Genghis"""".[citation needed]This is absolute nonsense.  There is a """"ch"""" sound in Persian (e.g. chahar, four).  The spelling """"Genghis"""" is more likely to have come from Marco Polo attempting to render the sound of Chinese.  It might be worth pointing out that, in that case, the initial G should be pronounced j or zh, and not like """"get"""" as so many people do.   Do we have a source either way? If not, then this kind of speculation is Original Research, and needs to be removed (that's why there is a [citation needed] there in the first place).   I've found a review that attributes the Genghis/Persian theory to Weatherford, and also refutes it based on historical documents. Therefore I've fixed the text in the article to explain that disagreement and pointing to the relevant source.   Genghis is not Western but the English, French and Spanish spelling, note it's written and pronounced with a """"ch"""" [ʧ] in Russian (Ч),  Mongolian (Ч), Tartar (Ç) and also German (Dsch-). The English spelling should follow the Russian, Mongolian and Tartar for this word, IMO.   German pronounciation is actually more like Jingis, with J as in Jungle.   The English name is and remains Genghis. It is not up to Wikipedia to decide whether it """"should"""" be or follow anything different.   Above statement is wrong. Genghis is almost never used in newly published (scholarly) books and articles in English these days. Most common spelling is Chingiz. Chingis also used. Genghis is now reserved for childrens' books and journalists, Wikipedia should change to reflect this.I have never seen anyone use Chingiz. Chinggis, Činggis etc. yes, but not Chingiz.   Looked at some sources and I was wrong above - Chinggis is most common, followed by Chingis and Chingiz in roughly equal second place. No matter how commonly Genghis is used in English, there's no escaping that it's wrong. 212.135.195.50  Just repeating such a statement doesn't make it true.

"1e2526e2d17ab62c",""" Very good. I still think some spinoff articles would be justified because many believe that the MK article should be reduced to an overview, but readers have requested even more extensive details, such as what has Knox said about the first call to her mother. I was thinking of emphasizing all the crime experts who have gone to Perugia, talked with police, and interviewed the students or friends over there. Hence, create """"Investigations of the Kercher murder"""" as a broader article, noting the prosecution/police viewpoint is just one investigation, then add Paul Ciolino, Joe Tacopina (ABC News """"20/20"""": SeattleT-77), Steve Moore, etc. In that article, we would jump into the forensic details, and highlight the controversial evidence (or lack of motives) as noted in each investigation. That would allow for answering those reader questions about the details. Also, we need a separate article """"Amanda Knox"""" because, unless that bio can be presented in a well-rounded way, she is inherently branded (for all of 2010) with the murder of MK. She is also notable for """"most-watched person on Italian TV"""" and the other lawsuits, not just the MK case. This is like the reverse of """"Separate but equal"""": Knox cannot be described in neutral terms, unless separated from the title & intro of the """"Murder"""" article, where she is listed as one of the """"convicted"""". In this situation, """"not separate is inherently tainted by the crime article, as equal to murderer"""" and cannot present an NPOV view of a person. Since """"separate is unequal"""" then not separate is equal. By extension, everyone still on trial (in a notable case) should be granted their own NPOV-neutral bio article, with their trial as only 1 section in their bios. So, if I formed a """"WikiProject Legal Cases"""" then I would recommend separate articles for all """"presumed innocent"""" who, later, could be merged back into the crime article when the typical appeals had ended.

She explores the dynamic of maintaining her feminism, while also enjoying male, particularly black male culture, and discusses balancing feminism while also benefitting from some parts of the gendered nature of society. She asks herself questions like """"Can you be a good feminist and admit out loud that there are things that you kinda dig about patriarchy?"""" and """"Suppose you don't want to pay for your own dinner, hold the door open, fix things, move furniture, or get intimate with whatever's under the hood of a car""""?

See, I dont know for sure if you have published something.But the point is, when the admin is as novice as a non-admin user in a topic, any stand the admin takes is hazardous. The admin may get disturbed by the new-user's edit and he starts to wield his powers. Even worse, the admin forms a POV and pushes it through. He has the powers. And the total purpose is defeated. Instead of being objective, he may take it personal and very often quotes WIKI rules, blocks as trolls, reports as vandalism etc. to win. Becoming a WIKIPEDIA ADMIN doesn't make anyone an automatic authority on any topic. Its highly unfortunate that, people are becoming admins by doing minor edits and staying for longer periods on wikipedia. Once they get the adminship, the power corrupts these people. Particularly, people who still suffer from Eurocentrism , cause even more damage. This is the case that is being argued. Other admins that should be checked, as I notice, are DBACHMAN & RUDRASHARMAN. There may be many more. Unless the rules for adminship are amended to prevent this hazard, Sensitive articles continue to remain in the stranglehold of eurocentric admins.

Quite a lot of consilidation done tonight; I'm much happier with the current text than before. From my POV the main remaining problem is the lead paragraph which I hope the current text demonstates is seriously misleading. Here is my proposed new version:In physics and cosmology, the anthropic principle was originally the rule of reasoning that we should take account of the constraints that our existence as observers imposes on the sort of universe that we could observe. The term has since been extended to cover supposed """"superlaws"""" that in various ways require the universe to support intelligent life, usually assumed to be carbon-based, and occasionally to be specifically human beings. Anthropic reasoning involves assessing these constraints by analysing the properties of universes with different fundamental parameters or laws of physics from ours, and has frequently concluded that essential structures, from atomic nuclei to the whole universe, depend for stability on delicate balances between different fundamental forces; balances which only occur in a small minority of possible universes — so that ours seems to be  fine-tuned for life. Anthropic reasoning also attempts to explain and quantify this fine tuning. Within the scientific community the usual approach is to invoke selection effects from a real ensemble of alternate universes; competing strategies, occasionally also called anthropic, include intelligent Design.  This would allow some shortening of the second para discussing controversies. You can see that I plan to have Anthropic reasoning re-direct to this page.  You can also see that I think we should avoid getting hung up on the tautologous nature of some statements of the AP (including the one you like), because I do think that misses the point.(c.f. new first para to the Character of Anthropic reasoning section). Oh, another proposal: merge the Bostrom section into the Variants, i.e. add his self sampling assumption as an AP-type statement. What do you think?  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

My point is that the scientists considered for representing the entire scientific population, groups 1-3 from above, are not a representative sample.  Therefore it is not appropriate to make the """"small minority of scientists"""" claim.  The only accurate way to assess the opinions of a large group of scientists is to poll them, as every researcher does not necessarily believe every word in a study they participate in. Maybe the larger question is this: what do scientist's opinions matter? They don't get paid to have opinions, but to do objective research.  Let's talk about the results.

I was recently blocked for my mentioning of major problems here because I did not assume """"Good Faith"""" when confronted with bad faith. I believe that the biggest problem with this article and thus the best way to improve it is to intensely follow the Jimbo guidelines to the T. I am going to post what I wrote on my talk page after being blocked during the controversy here. I could be more covert in my contempt for violations especially given my long but yet humble ranking amongst the Wiki Elite but abusing editors and monitors must be accountable or we will always suffer from their petty tyranny. This surely does not make me popular amongst them, yet I must assume """"good faith"""" in them so that they will not prejudice their views against me and comfort their own politics in the process.I was accused of supporting things I never did. All I ask is that criticism be included on par with other presidents. That is all. I don't especially care about Rev Wright, etc but if it is historical record and part of historically long campaign then I will stick my neck out for it.I have to say that the amount of bashing of media and talk that has nothing to do with improving the article is highly tolerated if it is left leaning but anything even center of that is treated with heavy hand and often banished and erased. that is what struck me about the discussion page - mind you I never made an edit on the actual article I was banned for merely talking on a talk page. it was the idea that these so called monitors are in fact just random non scholars at home abusing the tools of wikipedia to further their almost personal agenda in a group- think environment.Thin skin is no excuse for being literally fascistic in your approach to the open to the public - controlled by a small group of ideologues - Wikipedia. These political minding ideologues are 80-100% dominated by left wing or leaning people and controlled through even the excessive use of blocking for discussion posts and factual additions. These (not just mine) are non threatening non- offensive language - just the idea of one stating that their is a problem with the editors and monitors is cause to be blocked and potentially banned for not """"assuming good faith"""" or """"positively contributing to the consensus"""". what if the consensus is wrong then? What if about if you have already assumed Good Faith long ago and are simply diagnosing the major illness of the article as you see it? The evidence is more then abundant that these monitors are violating their tools and are involved in subterfuge or at least strong bias as evidenced between comparing Obama with W Bush. Additionally, the Obama Administration through proxies, in my strong opinion, is at work in the Obama article. I say this mainly because it is inconceivable to me that given the current administrations use and celebration of all things internet and aggressive pursuit of media outlets and shaping the publics opinion (as is understandable) that someone out of the thousands of Obama connected likely people is not involved on the Barack Obama page. It is the most visited page on Wikipedia and is one of the top hits for people searching the internet for the name Barack Obama. However, that is secondary to the already abundant supply of ideologue editors and monitors who seem to fill the demographic of the wikipedia junior officer ranks who enough of is all that it really takes. The number of those is in the millions. That is Why Jimbo guidelines must be followed as an example of the integrity of wikipedia as a REAL encyclopedia that could stand out in a scholarly work. The language given the Rulers of Wikipedia gives them broad ability to block and ban anyone they disagree with. OFten the language is contradictory. For instance I was blocked for my comments on the TALK page and cited for """"Making a point instead of wanting to edit"""". How, exactly, do you make a TALK page based discussion about edits without making a point? Another monitor told me I had to assume good faith, yet no good faith was given to me in my quest to improve article. In addition, the """"TALK"""" page says no writing will be allowed that involves """"general discussion"""" however that can be loosely interpreted and it could for instance only be 5% of what you wrote and then be grounds by a prejudiced monitor to remove your entire sections containing many posts. Additionally, the last guideline about general talk is only applied to people making comments critical or potentially scandalous to the President o",0,0,0,0,0,0

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

"5135caeb384ad4be",""" Timeshifter's dishonesty Timeshifter, your story above is text-book projection, first rate water-muddying, I grant you, but deceit nonetheless. But this follows the pattern of your edits. Your POV is clear throughout. It's pretty simple: you believe this recent Lancet study is the Truth, and, therefore you have to believe that virtually all other sources are way off. IraqBodyCount is a wild underestimate, ILCS is not """"legitimate"""" etc. Basically every edit you've made on all these pages is carefully orchestrated and loaded to lead everyone toward these beliefs. Now you're pissed that I've ever so slightly gotten in the way of your prolific POV-pushing by deleting a miniscule fraction of it, and now you're playing the victim. Let's put that act aside and look at what I've actually deleted. I've reverted basically three things here: 1. Lancet page - claims about a supposed """"ILCS baseline 2002 mortality rate"""". Fabrications do not belong on wiki pages. I deleted that fabrication. The only """"sourced material"""" I deleted was stuff about Lancet baseline rates that were cited accurately enough, but only had any relevance to this section because they were being related to the fabrication I was removing. Once the fabricated """"ILCS baseline rate"""" is removed, the surrounding """"sourced material"""" from Lancet that I deleted no longer has any relevance to the section. It is entirely out of context and so properly removed along with the fabrication. The """"sourced material"""" that was there makes no sense being there unless the fabrication is there, so I removed it along with the fabrication. 2. IBC page - I deleted an inaccurate and out of context claim authored by Timeshifter. I added a statement which says IBC showed an example of something, and provided a citation for this. Timeshifter then adds that Lancet authors dispute this claim from IBC, and he puts a footnote onto this, but the footnote leads to quotes by Lancet authors that address something else entirely. Thus, this claim of Timeshifter's is properly removed as it is falsely described as one thing when it is something else, and the citation leads to something that is different than how it's described. So the first two are just simple falsehoods and fabrications. Apparently it's """"against the rules"""" and """"POV-favoring"""" to delete POV-pushing falsehoods and fabrications.3. IBC page - Guatemala study. I've questioned the relevance of this to IBC, and the accuracy of the description, and discussed this on the talk page. This one is at least more debatable than the others, as it is just tangential cherry-picking for a POV, rather than just fabrications and falsehoods for a POV.Deleting these three things has been my great crime, causing poor Timeshifter so much pain and anguish, yeah right. As I've already said, I can't keep up with Timeshifter's proselytizing for the Lancet study on all these various pages. He's very commited to the cause, as proselytizers tend to be.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

"a7e58789a37ca194","""We can have material split across three articles, if that is the best way to do it.  Or we can have two articles, with a redirect from new antisemtitism to contemporary antisemitism, or vice versa.  The advantage of multiple articles is that it gives a sharper focus on a specific issue.  The disadvantage is duplication.  The problem I have with the current article is that it isn't clear to me what the distinction between new antisemitism and 'old' antisemitism is, or even if there is one.  Some duplication is OK but when I have no way to decide what should go into new antisemitism and what should go into antisemitism, I think there's a problem.  The advantage of contemporary antisemitism over new antisemitism is that it has quite a clear definition.  The advantage of new antisemitism over contemporary antisemitism could be that new antisemitism is not just antisemitism in the here and now but somehow something different.  That we have a history of new antisemitism suggests that a difference exists, but I don't see what that difference is.The current introduction says that new antisemitism is """"the wave of antisemitism that escalated, particularly in Western Europe, after the Second Intifada in 2000, the failure of the Oslo accords, and the September 11, 2001 attacks."""" But it then says what is different about new antisemitism is that old antisemitism """"was largely associated with the political right.""""  So I'm confused.  Is it the distinguishing factor the timing, or is it more to do with the source, in which case perhaps we should be talking not about new antisemitism but about new antisemites; a new chorus singing an old song?  In the introduction we mention anti-zionism in passing, but we don't make clear what the relationship between it and new antisemitism is, we just say that there is one.The history section talks about a Soviet new anti-Semitism, and says this antisemtism was """"close to its modern form"""".  But it doesn't explain what close means.  Presumably there are important ways in which it is similar and ways in which it is different, but the article doesn't explain what they are.Further down, we seem to be equating new antisemitism with anti-zionism.  Maybe this is the crux of my issues with this article.  We have anti-zionism; hatred of/opposition to an jewish state.  We have anti-semitism; hatred of/opposition to the jewish race (common usage. technically arabs are also semites, but lets not go there now).   We can also identify anti-Israel sentiment; opposition to some or all aspects of Israel.  These things all overlap, but it's hard to say that any of them are the same, or a subset of each other.  For example there were jews opposed to the creation of Israel because it was man-made, not created by god.  And some dislike of Israel is anti-semitic, but not all of it.  The boundaries are fuzzy, but for each of these concepts there is a clear and unmistakable core.  I can't say that for new-antisemtism.  I can't identify what new-antisemitism is that old-antisemtism is not.To me, new antisemitism seems to be a grab bag of an expression that mixes some different issues:  1. the apparent resurgence in antisemitism, which I suggest properly belongs at contemporary antisemitism; 2. the difficulty in distinguishing between legitimate/illegitimate criticism of israel, which I suggest belongs here, or possibly at anti-zionism; and 3. the changing nature of the anti-semite (left/right/arab/european/russian/...) which I suggest belongs at contemporary antisemitism and/or at antisemitism.

"a6c1da41b2a8eadd","""Relevance of True Believers SyndromeAndries, what is the relevance of adding a section about """"True Believers Syndrome""""? It appears you are pushing your POV by adding this section. Explain why you insist on adding this section and how it does not violate a NPOV.  talk-email It is relevant for the article: SSB is mentioned in the article True believer syndrome.  You are pushing your Anti-Sai bias by including an empty reference to """"True Believers Syndrome"""". If you attempt to include it, I am going to remove it. I guess it is only coincidence that you happened to create the page for """"True Believers Syndrome""""? Ref  talk-email Well, the inclusion of this article in the see also section seems to be yet another subject for mediation, otherwise we'll keep reverting each other until one of us dies.  Andries, the  Wikipedia policy WP:NOT states that Wikipedia is not a soapbox.  I suspect that we have differing views regarding what this means.  From my perspective, the aim of many of your edits, such as the one which sparked this subsection, appears to be to convince people of the merits of your favorite views.    I would very much like for you to share your views on the WP:NOT policy and your understanding of what this policy means.   Please note that I had removed the true believer syndrome as described by Robert Todd Carroll from the main text in the article, because Jossi complained that people mentioned in this article were not notable. I objected to that by saying that everybody mentioned in this article was mentioned either by reputable media sources or scholarly sources that reported about SSB. Later I found out that the only one who was not mentioned by reputable news articles was Robert Todd Carroll who wrote entries in his book and website Skeptic's Dictionary about SSB and the true believer syndrome in which he mentioned SSB. So I decided to move the true believer syndrome from the main text to the see also section. I think it should stay there because it is clearly relevant for the article. With regards to violating the Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not policy I think that only one sentence could be relevant in this dispute and that is """"[Wikipedia is not] Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. """" I think I would be breaking """"What Wikipedia is Not"""" policy if I linked the word charlatan in the see also section, unless of course, SSB is mentioned in that article.  Of course, it will be clear that I do not agree with the critical information being minimized, but I do not think that I am breaking the policy here: SSB is very controversial and this article should reflect that.  Andries, thanks for pointing this out. It is apparent I need to edit the """"True Believer's Syndrome"""" article because its mention to SSB is not referenced by reputable sources. You attempt to make your case against SSB by citing the non-reputable and original research of Tony O'Clery and Paul Holbach. Either you reference these citations by reputable sources or I'm deleting it. I am going to remove the references to O'Clery and Holbach (whose link does not work anyway). Trying to cite the """"True Believer's Syndrome"""" article because it refers to SSB is deceptive because you were the one who made that reference to SSB on that page.  talk-email Hi Andries, thank-you for your response.  I am glad you agree that if you created a see-also link to charlatan that this would not reflect Wikipedia policies.  However, I do not understand your reasoning that seems to differentiate between a link to charlatan and a link to True Believer's Syndrome.  From my perspective, it seems that a see-also link to charlatan would be innuendo that SSB is a charlatan, while a  see-also link to TBS seems to be innuendo that devotees of SSB suffer from TBS.  In both cases, it seems to me that NPOV is violated because controversial opinions are not presented as such.  Rather, the implication of a see-also link to TBS is that Wikipedia is voicing the opinion that devotees of SSB suffer from TBS.NEWLIN",0,0,0,0,0,0

Many have been uploaded on commons with an antiquated and questionable PD rationale, and are likely to get deleted in the near future.

I presume the PD release for the text is there to help him popularize such nonsense (""""read me, copy me""""), but the images are still copyrighted by their original authors, from whom the author took his images without proper credit. Unless I see some serious arguments as to why to keep the images, sometime in the near future, I myself will visit wikicommons with a couple of deletion requests.

I'd like to try to address some of those concerns.If I'm not mistaken (and please correct me if I am), this seems to be your core concern: """"I believe it is confusing to a person searching for that name to find another name.""""  You might be unaware of this, but Wikipedia has a """"redirect"""" feature that can take a commonly used search term and re-point it to the article it refers to, if that article exists under a different name.  You can try this: type """"The Wild Center"""" into Wikipedia's search box; it should take you to the Natural History Museum of the Adirondacks article.From a reader's perspective, the redirect does have the potential to be confusing: """"I typed in one thing, and the big headline at the article says something completely different!""""  Naturally we don't want such confusion.  There are two things that can help.  One is that Wikipedia will show a little message saying """"(Redirected from The Wild Center)"""" so the user at least knows they didn't somehow hit the """"Random article"""" link or something like that.  Another one that the editors of the target article can do is to make sure the common search terms are mentioned.  In this case, the article's lead sentence highlights this by introducing """"The Wild Center"""" as an alternative name, and it's in boldface so it's harder to miss.  A person searching on """"The Wild Center"""" and arriving at the Natural History Museum of the Adirondacks article will probably not be very confused, since they'll see """"The Wild Center"""" prominently displayed on the page, and since they'll more than likely already know that The Wild Center is a museum of natural history located in the Adirondacks, so the full official name is unlikely to surprise them.You also say """"I think that the Museum has the right to choose its own name.""""  I don't think anyone would disagree with that, but it's reasonable to think that the nickname """"The Wild Center"""" could be in vogue for a few years and then replaced by another nickname. (""""The Otter Stop"""", perhaps? )  If there's a stable, official name that will stick with it for as long as it's a museum, it makes some sense to use that name for the article title and to set up redirects for all of the popular nicknames.  The purpose of Wikipedia is not to aid the museum in marketing itself, but it's definitely reasonable to adopt some of the marketing phrases if that's how a significant number of people might identify the place.Does this satisfy any of your concerns?

But there are many variants of these diagrams (e.g. workflow diagrams, workflow nets and even some dialects of Business process modeling are graphically similar) the definition given here is not 'activity diagrams' which is sort of a reserved keyword for the definition of OMG. So, moving the text to Process-data diagram seems a very good idea and would satisfy me fully. Or even leaving it where it is in metadata modeling if that is the term they use to refer to this kind of models, and removing the redundant text from metamodeling page as I initially suggested (hmm, took out my hatchet and did it!). I think what went wrong is the interpretation of the discussion at the top of this discussion page: people were complaining that metamodeling page was polluted by Utrecht definition of the term, and that by 'squatting' the term, some information on the more generally accepted definition of the term ended up on this [metamodeling technique] page. But I think the more generally useful info was extracted from that page already. The merge was suggested as a way of providing an example """"provided it is very clear this is not the definition of metamodeling"""".

"5a6042e99815bc35","First and foremost, Lynda Kiejko won a gold medal and a quota in the 10 m air pistol, and added her second gold in the 25 m pistol. Because she already earned a quota in the air pistol, the Olympic slot has been distributed to the runner-up Sandra Uptagrafft of the United States. Granted the athlete has not yet earned a quota for their country means that a quota must be distributed to a different athlete from any country, as long as the NOC has been entitled to a maximum of two shooters per event. In Kiejko's case, she is eligible to compete in the 25 m pistol, but her place must be confirmed by the NOC and ISSF, along with the quota she won in the 10 m pistol.  Second, I notice that you added Michel Dion of Canada. Cassio Rippel already won a quota in the 50 m rifle prone. Because Brazil has reserved a place in each of the nine events, and he competes for the host nation, this does not imply that the quota has been distributed to Dion. As per rules on the host country places, these will only be granted in any of the nine places entrusted to the host nation, if it did not obtain any place in that event during the qualification period. With Rippel's victory at the Pan American Games, the host country still keeps a quota in the 50 m rifle prone. If he is confirmed by NOC to compete for the Olympics as long as he obtains the MQS (minimum qualifying score), then the unused host country place will be reallocated to the NOC with the highest MQS that has not yet obtained a quota place or been granted a Tripartite Invitation for the Games.I hope that you fully grasped the rules and regulations on the distribution of Olympic quota.

Seems like Wikipedia really effed the heck up!Clinical, cosmetic and investigational dermatology  CCIDDove PressMorgellons disease: Analysis of a population with clinically confirmed microscopic subcutaneous fibers of unknown etiologyVirginia R Savely and Raphael B StrickerAdditional article informationAbstractBackground:Morgellons disease is a controversial illness in which patients complain of stinging, burning, and biting sensations under the skin. Unusual subcutaneous fibers are the unique objective finding. The etiology of Morgellons disease is unknown, and diagnostic criteria have yet to be established. Our goal was to identify prevalent symptoms in patients with clinically confirmed subcutaneous fibers in order to develop a case definition for Morgellons disease.Methods:Patients with subcutaneous fibers observed on physical examination (designated as the fiber group) were evaluated using a data extraction tool that measured clinical and demographic characteristics. The prevalence of symptoms common to the fiber group was then compared with the prevalence of these symptoms in patients with Lyme disease and no complaints of skin fibers.Results:The fiber group consisted of 122 patients. Significant findings in this group were an association with tick-borne diseases and hypothyroidism, high numbers from two states (Texas and California), high prevalence in middle-aged Caucasian women, and an increased prevalence of smoking and substance abuse. Although depression was noted in 29% of the fiber patients, pre-existing delusional disease was not reported. After adjusting for nonspecific symptoms, the most common symptoms reported in the fiber group were: crawling sensations under the skin; spontaneously appearing, slow-healing lesions; hyperpigmented scars when lesions heal; intense pruritus; seed-like objects, black specks, or “fuzz balls” in lesions or on intact skin; fine, thread-like fibers of varying colors in lesions and intact skin; lesions containing thick, tough, translucent fibers that are highly resistant to extraction; and a sensation of something trying to penetrate the skin from the inside out.Conclusions:This study of the largest clinical cohort reported to date provides the basis for an accurate and clinically useful case definition for Morgellons disease.Keywords: Morgellons, subcutaneous fibers, pruritus, delusions of parasitosis, Lyme disease, skin lesionsIntroductionMorgellons disease is a poorly understood multisystem illness characterized by stinging, biting, and crawling sensations under the skin.1 According to the Morgellons Research Foundation (MRF) website, more than 14,000 families are reportedly affected by this emerging disease.2 Considerable suffering occurs as thread-like fibers work their way out of the victim’s skin causing pain, itching, and open, disfiguring lesions (Figures 1 and ​and2).2). Unfortunately, patients are often dismissed as delusional by clinicians who are unfamiliar with the signs and symptoms of Morgellons disease.3–5 There is a scarcity of literature on Morgellons disease due to its relatively recent description in the modern medical literature, the reluctance on the part of the medical community to recognize it as anything other than psychopathology, and the lack of knowledge about its etiology and transmission.6TABFigure 1Morgellons patient’s lower legs. Similar lesions covered her trunk and arms. There were no excoriations or secondary infections. Photo courtesy of Cindy Casey, Charles E Holman Foundation, Austin, Texas.

Photo courtesy of Cindy Casey, Charles E Holman Foundation, Austin, Texas. Reproduced with permission.The distinctive feature of Morgellons disease is the presence of microscopic subcutaneous fibers1 (Figures 3, ​,4,4, and ​and5).5). Observation of the skin with a lighted, hand-held, 30 × to 60 × magnifier enables visualization of these red, blue, black, and white fibers that have the appearance of either straight hollow tubes or wiry tangled threads.1 At times the fibers are seen above the dermis as loosely clumped “fuzz balls” or as black specks the size of coffee grains. Examination of the black specks by electron microscopy reveals that they consist of a tightly woven ball of black fibers.6TABFigure 3Close up of a leg lesion showing a twisted fiber just under the epidermis.

Articles are to be written NPOV - that doesnt mean that articles dont ever use Biblespeak, rather when it is used, its used in proper context: """"In the Bible, etc. etc."""" This is not the Schucmanism Encyclopedia. Even if the claim that Jesus wrote the thing was universal among Christians, this is not the Christian Encyclopedia.  Im not particularly attached to the term ghostwriting, but your wording - that [whatever it was called] is like channeling, etc - was not neutral, and placed too much emphasis on a trivial matter - trivial, because supernatural claims, despite our understanding of them in faith, are not encyclopedically substantive. This is of course the problem with religion - a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and a lot of knowledge of just one thing is just plain dogma. You seem to be asserting that there is a dogmatic bias in wikipedia regarding the Bible.

As you read this, you do not have to feel sorry for me as it is a universal truth that we all must die someday. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as thatwas the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just accumulating all the wealth in the world as I lay helplessly on my sick bed.If I was given a second chance to live again, I'm sure I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it owing to what has befallen me now. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Seventy Five Million United States Dollars ($75, 000, 000.00) that I have with a Finance Vaulting Unit in Europe.All I am asking of you is to assist me in making the collection of this deposit and dispatching the funds to anycharity of your choice.N/B: Kindly note that 30% of this funds must go to the tsunami victims, 50% to other Charity Organization and 20% for your effort and time. I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation,as I am using my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you.Please contact me as soon as you get this email if you are capable and sincere to handle this transaction on my behalf so that I can forward to you all relevant documents necessary for the claims and the name of the security firm where the funds are deposited and a picture of my present condition.

Putting aside if one considers this a credible offer or possible. The clearest example of this (again putting aside what one thinks of it) was again by the Iraqi government on December 11, 1975 putting full page advertisements in numerous Western newspapers (The New York Times, Toronto Star, and Le Monde) asking any Iraqi Jews who left Iraq to feel free to return to Iraq (again putting aside whether one views this as a genuine offer or not). This page is sourced  and is done by someone with a Ph. D.  Also the reality of the existence of in particular the Iraqi government advertisements of December 11, 1975 (calling for any Iraqi Jews to come back to Iraq) is admitted even by ideologically Zionist website [www.eretzyisroel.org/~jkatz/discredit.html] which state that pro-Zionist groups """"scoffed at"""" the Iraqi offer. This info should be included and the sources are valid (written by a Ph. D.), especially if writings of the """"JCPA"""" is included as the JCPA is an obviously partisan think-tank associated with the Israeli Likud party in particular (so any noting of the legitimate sources I'm providing, putting aside the pro-Zionist source corroborating in particular the 1975 Iraqi government advertisements, being partisan to one side should also then have the """"JCPA"""" links and writings removed for partisan reasons). This info should be included in the """"compensation"""" section as it by itself (the offer, whether one believes it or things like it are genuine or not) would be an offer of not just """"compensation"""" but a return to where one originally came from in the first place.

L. Heilbron ( ) In an older and closely related meaning, """"science"""" also refers to a body of knowledge itself, of the type that can be rationally explained and reliably applied. A practitioner of science is known as a scientist.In modern usage, """"science"""" may refer as well to a way of pursuing or producing knowledge, not only the knowledge itself. Especially in the anglophone world """"science"""" is often restricted to those branches of study that seek to explain the phenomena of the material universe.Oxford English Dictionary The German approach of """"Wissenschaften"""" in the tradition of Humboldtian science and Humboldtian education ideal is more generic and includes all sort of scholarly endeavours with philosophy still as a common denominator. The The Two Cultures the German Positivism dispute and the US science wars refer to ongoing controversies about the role of natural sciences and the humanities. The controversies refered as well to the longstanding dominance of male White Anglo-Saxon Protestant scholars in e.g. US universities and the use of """"Dead white European men"""" as role models. It has lead to various attempts, as in gender studies to involve e.g. female or minority perspectives in science and as well a backslash defending the important role of the classics.Bernard Knox, The Oldest Dead White European Males and Other Reflections on the Classics (1993) (reprint, W.

This is, after all, a page in the Wikipedia and not your personal property. Is that not so? These facts are as follows:1) Substantial numbers of horses which show many characteristics of purebred Appaloosas have been found in 2014 living in a remote mountain valley of Kyrgyzstan near the Chinese border. These horses exhibit spots, white sclerae, and striped hooves.2) a DNA analysis conducted by Dr. Gus Cothran at Texas A & M University shows that these Kyrgyzstan horses closely match purebred  American Appaloosas in their genetics.3) As of 2015, controversy exists as to whether these horses should be considered true Appaloosas. A BBC documentary shows the 69-year-old female New Zealand Appaloosa breeder who rode horseback over a 13,777 foot mountain pass to find these horses. This documentary clearly shows these horses in their native milieu and discusses the DNA evidence.Now Mr. Montanabw Sir, are those facts not true?  Are they not germane? People come to this Wikipedia Appaloosa page to learn current and pertinent facts about Appaloosas. In that context neither your opinion nor mine count for a plug nickel.Therefore I will now repeat my question . Exactly why are you continuing to refuse the addition of these facts to this Wikipedia page? If you wish, I don't see why an additional section cannot be added entitled """"Kyrgyzstan horse controversy"""" containing this information. Can you? Because if we can't resolve this question here, that is the issue I am going to ask the next level to resolve. I will not ask them to decide about LP genes or whether the BBC has made up some fairy story about the Appaloosa or whether the moon is made of green cheese.

You seem to have covered most of the important bases, but there's not a whole lot of information in each. Some of the sections also cover information that would be better places elsewhere (as previously noted, in addition to mentioning Smart's Emmys in """"Concept and creation"""", it seems that would be better elsewhere or at least belongs in a subsection).

Please stop doing that.  My dear 81.202.96.146, please stop asking me to stop from doing this or that, for it is not your duty to tell me so. Give your opinion and defend it as you may, as I am doing, and put the full stop after it. Now, it seems that we cannot insert anything here that raises the slightest doubt against the legitimacy of """"those independentist movements"""". Sorry, I won't bother creating an article entitled """"Terrorist groups linked to X nationalism""""; but I do believe that if there's an article that deals with """"X nationalism"""" or """"Nationalities in Y"""", which includes """"X nationalism"""", it is only right to talk about those terrorist groups. To your accusation: I already assumed above that I was biased, as anyone else (my quote: """"Of course, this I'm saying is only part of the story; but it corresponds with the same reality and nothing about it is being said in this biased article.""""). I haven't edited the article yet, because I think the subject is worthy of a discussion, no matter how ridiculous the article itself seems to me. Due to 1's """" as anyone else"""", your accusation can bounce back at you with a very slight variation: you are trying to prevent obnoxious information about nationalism from entering the article, thus unveiling your point of view... So, what's wrong about it? The problem with your POV is that you already stated something false about the article to defend your position and I refuted it. Your only answer now is to say that my views should belong to another article.I don't know what your reasons are for defending the accuracy of this article; clearly not the article itself. My own are simply that, if we are to talk about such a delicate subject as """"nationalities in Spain"""" we'd better document ourselves and tell everything that ought to be told.  Why can´t I ask you to stop doing something I find incorrect? You are in fact, doing the same, by asking me not to do it. See the irony? I wasn´t issuing orders, just asking kindly for you to stop doing that. If you don´t want to, it´s ok.By order:1- Everyone is biased, that´s ok. But Wikipedia is not a soapbox. If you want to voice your personal concerns about """"spanish speakers opressed in Catalonia"""", that´s fine with me, but please don´t do it in an eclyclopedical article right? When we contribute to a wikipedia article, it´s not enough to go """"OK I´m biased because I think this and that, so let the battle begin"""". No, we try to put aside our differences and be as neutral as possible. I´m not trying to point out my ideas in an article, as if I were hoping to clash with you and eventually """"reach a middle ground"""" in the article´s content. No. I´m trying to be objective in this article, and you´re not, because you´re admiting to be biased AND allowing your bias to affect your output in this article.2- That´s very respectful of you, and I think it´s the right thing to do.3- No it doesn´t. I am not trying to push an agenda here. I am just pointing the OBVIOUS LOGICAL fact that articles should talk about the topic they´re about. If I, for example tried to hide the racialist doctrines Sabino Arana had, in an article about Sabino Arana, you could rightfully accuse me of """"preventing obnoxious information"""" from getting into the article. But asking for an article named Nationalities in Spain to talk about those nationalities and not about terrorist gangs that claim to defend some of the ideologies that support independentist claims based on the actual nationalities we´re talking about in this article, is just asking for something entirely reasonable. See the far away link between your proposed """"terrorist issue"""" stuff and the actual content of the article? As I said, create an article about Terrorist gangs linked to nationalist claims in Spain, and everything will be fine. By your same reasoning, anyone could end up talking about the IRA in an article about Catholicism.4- What did I state that was false? I made only one comment before this one, just to ask you to stop trying to shove terrorist stuff in an article that is not about terrorism. Seems perfectly reasonable to me.

Do you dispute the fact, or the way in which it was written? I am open to rewriting/compromising to get consensus on an NPOV, but if you are not willing to explain yourself, this will be very difficult. Do you really think that the umberella term 'naturopathic medicine' is represenatative of single entity, group or way of practicing medicine? Could you back this up?

Again, do you dispute this fact or the way it was written? I have provided citations for this, did you even consult them before deleting my work? Can you provide a citation asserting the opposite (that naturopathic medicine is an exlusive term owned and used by a single organisation to the exlusion of other types of practitioners)?Your assertion that naturopathic medicine is 'CAM, not medicine' could be misconstrued to reveal a deep and irrational bias on your behalf.

Section 8 enumerates the powers authorized to the United States Congress. The Fourth Amendment, which states:  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. The Tenth Amendment, which states: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. The legal encyclopedia American Jurisprudence says the following in regard to constitutionality: The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute, though having the form and the name of law, is in reality no law, but is wholly void and ineffective for any purpose since unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enactment and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it; an unconstitutional law, in legal contemplation, is as inoperative as if it had never been passed ... An unconstitutional law is void. (16 Am. Jur. 2d, Sec. 178)These are fine legal arguments and I personally agree with them. But they clearly represent a personal judgement (correct as it it may be) on a controversial political topic. But that is not what Wikipedia is about. WP:NPOV implies that statements of opinion, such as The REAL ID Act violates the following articles and amendments of the United States Constitution, are not appropriate in a WP article. It would be perfectly OK to say, however, something like Critics charge that the REAL ID Act violates the following articles and amendments of the United States and then provide a reference to some reliable sourcewhere such criticism is raised. As your edit reads now, not only does it represent a statement of opinion, but the way in which this opinion is justified also, in my view, violates WP:NOR. Instead of citing some sources where consititutionality of the Real ID Act is questioned in the way you describe, you list some general legal sources that in your view (and in mine)justify your opinion. This is a clear instance of original research that WP:NOR prohibits.There are plenty of newsarticles and other reliable sources that criticize the Real ID Act and I think you will not have much trouble finding a few of them that raise the same points as your edit does. So if you want to make a constructive input, please find such sources and add them to the article. Regards,   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

This can be observed in cases when locked on to the tailgating mode, all other lanes are free to move and drive faster even within limit and surely free of obstacle of slower cars in front, but those drivers on autopilot persist and do not notice of the opportunity to change lane. Often they do tailgate for a long distance without changing lane which is free for some time and only when you decide to do so or come from behind, they come suddenly in front of you. This is partially subconscious. Our peripheral vision is sensitive to movement, their brain register this, they immediately notice that the object they notices (you) moves on or into free lane, they make immediately reactive rather than fully conscious and rational decision and they move dangerously in front of you.

"52a88a1d51fa70cf",""" Please help me end this drama once in for all I really do hate to get start making accusations, but I feel as if User:Delicious carbuncle is seriously heading down a road of corruption. It all started over a simple proposal at WP:VILLAGE where I skeptically proposed an idea for a template similar to the Template:Romeo warning for silly vandals apparently belonging to cheerleading squads. DC then started questioning my actions at WP:ABUSE, in which case I appropriately addressed his concerns. However, he seems to possibly have a problem with either my involvement at the project or perhaps even the project as a whole. He posted my real life first name, high school, and high school mascot in an example, in which case I raised concerns of WP:OUTING (note that his previous block for outing is unrelated). He said that it was merely a random name he chose, and I've chosen to WP:AGF in the matter, and you may treat that matter however you so desire. After receiving a comment on his talk page from a blatant IP troll that's been harassing me for over a month, he decided to start looking into the trolls claims about my handling of a repeat offender mainly known here as User:LBHS Cheerleader. He started heatedly questioning my actions, asking for diffs about bans. I had removed a """"suspected sockpuppet"""" template stating that the user might be related to User:Bobabobabo (which I had added over a year ago) and replaced it with a banned template since although I feel it's inappropriate that we were using Boba's ban against LBHSC without evidence, I similiarily felt it was inappropriate to all of a sudden to consider her """"debanned."""" I also added LBHSC to the list of community banned users as it seemed to be a consensus to me. I probably should have discussed this first, but I did not in light of WP:BOLD and WP:DENY (I didn't want to start a thread without absolutely needing to). Per WP:DUCK, it seems pretty obvious that LBHSC and her minions have been vandalizing for quite some time, at least since 2006, probably ban-worthy. However, I gracefully removed the contested templates when Delicious carbuncle started a thread at WP:AN/I in attempt to calmly settle the issue, and even stated that I would voluntarily abandon my efforts to combat LBHSC's disruption (beyond non-controversial reverting of blatant vandalism of course). DC ruthlessly refused to compromise, and I even contemplated retirement if only to save my name """"PCHS-NJROTC."""" Even then DC was not satisfied. Several users argued that LBHSC should indeed be considered banned as she would likely never be unblocked, including highly respected admins. Many editors, administrators, and even members of the WP:ArbCom have expressed their opinion that DC should move on. Even an admin who felt I had acted out of line and should be blocked stated that there's not enough support to keep the discussion going. Although there were those who defended my actions 100%, felt that although that the user should be banned but I should have discussed first, felt that I was being power hungry, and even thought that my actions were abusive, the general consenus of everybody was that I had offered settlement, learned important lessons, and that good faith should be assumed. Despite consensus, DC continued to revive the discussion over and over again, providing nothing new, and basically insisting on action. He has been warned repeatedly by several respected editors. He had stopped, and I had disengaged. I really wish this could have stayed in the past. However, Delicious carbuncle started User:Delicious_carbuncle/PCHS-NJROTC_ban_redux in the dawn of the new year. Considering the edit summary he used when creating the page, I initially thought his intentions were to use that as an arguement against someone who he is in conflict with known as User:Neutralhomer. In desire to not be involved in his conflict, I nominated the page for deletion at WP:MFD. I viewed it simply as an attack page which did not help the encyclopedia. I could have nominated for WP:CSD, but I didn't want to say that he was """"attacking me"""" as I was in favor of disengagement as was recommended at AN/I. In response to the MfD, he indicated that he intends to start yet another ban discussion. I'm not sure if he's wanting a topic ban on vandalism as before (which really isn't even a topic) or an all out ban. I did indicate that I would not stay here if I was topic banned, and that I would just assume be renamed to something unaffiliated with me (i.e. Vandal Fighter Missing in Action) and then be fully banned, but thankfully there's no support for either a topic ban or all out ban.

"11873bff44b41a65",""":: uhhh, we could also add Standford Shaw on the list and last time I checked, he was a western scholar. As for the rest of your text Mr. Kojian, the fact of the matter remains that there is no concrete evidence written or otherwise that the Ottoman goverment of the time gave explicit or even implicit instructions to exterminate the community of Armenians for racial reasons. Until a time comes where there is substantiative proof that such instructions were given, it is totally misleading to coin the term genocide to the tragic events that unfolded in 1915-16. And it doesnt matter if there were a zillion eyewitnesses who funny enough all turn up to be christians, the most famous of which was Lepsius the racist protestant who was obsessed with preserving the """"good image"""" of Germany.   No evidence?  Oh brother.  Have you read the article?  Believe me, every Armenian in Anatolia did not commit suicide to make Muslims look bad, and Germany look good.  I'm glad you admit though that you don't care if there were a zillion eyewitnesses, since you know better than the people who saw it with their own eyes.    I dont think you get my point which is that your sources of the period in question may very well have been biased maybe? You have to get rid of the typical mindset of  if it supports the genocide thesis, it must be an objective, unbiased source! If not, it has to be someone that is in the Turkish goverment payrolls! This approach of yours and most of those that support the genocide thesis is far from being constructive and is one of the reasons that this issue is not being addressed properly!   Addressed properly? Go ahead and address this.  Did the population of Armenians in Anatolia drop from around 2 million to around zero during WWI and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey?  And did that drop in population take place due directly to actions of Ottoman/Turkish authorities?  Yes or no.  No maybes, no yes but, no nothing else. There is no justification for genocide, and we don't even need Christian eyewitnesses to tell us that the Armenians are gone - while the Turks and Kurds were fruitful and multiplied.    First of all your figure on the number of Armenians in Anatolia is grossly exagerated, Ottoman census figures before the war put the total at below 1 million in the eastern provinces. Even the Armenian patriarchate put the figure slightly above a million so I dont know where you dug that ridiculous sum from (could be your mind playing tricks which happens when you are exposed to too much propaganda)! As for the numbers dropping close to zero, if its the eastern provinces you are referring to, its what seems to have happened as a result of relocation. Have you even bothered to read through the information provided from the Ottoman archives in the links under the section on those that oppose the genocide thesis? If not, it would very well explain your flawed opinion on this subject!  In theory the edit is not so bad. But the problem is that it only gives credance to those that say the events aren't """"settled"""". There needs to be an equal amount of discussion on those that say these things did happen, at the very least. And, to be honest, the edit just throws names around - there's nothing in the articles to say that they have a particular position.   Hellooo, this is the OPPOSITION section of the article. You can include the names of 'scholars' accepting it in the academic recognition section, I've no problem with that. These scholars exactly say the following in their declaration (word-by-word) """"The weight of evidence so far uncovered points in the direct of serious inter communal warfare (perpetrated by Muslim and Christian irregular forces), complicated by disease, famine, suffering and massacres in Anatolia and adjoining areas during the First World War. Indeed, throughout the years in question, the region was the scene of more or less continuous warfare, not unlike the tragedy, which has gone on in Lebanon for the past decade. The resulting death toll among both Muslim and Christian communities of the region was immense. But much more remains to be discovered before historians will be able to sort out precisely responsibility between warring and innocent, and to identify the causes for the events which resulted in the death or removal of large numbers of the eastern Anatolian population, Christian and Muslim alike.

In fact because you knowingly provided a false justification for deletion merits you being removed from being a Wikipedia Arbitrator, in addition to the previous complaint I made against you about your anti-catholic hate filled username.  The Epopt provides this explanation for the meaning of hisuserame: -Mason Boyne, Presbyterian bigot and Orange Lodgemember, says to his wife, “Did you know, Morag, that if you spell ‘Pope’ backwards you get ‘Epop,’ which is a four-letter word beginning with ‘E’ like ‘Evil’? You see, it's all there in the Bible if you just shoogle the letters around a bit.”The fact that you continue to harrass and interject yourself in a complaint and arbitration between pro-occult and anti-occult editors shows your complete disregard for Wikipedia guidelines, and is further proof you should be permanently revoked from being a Wikipedia Arbitrator.      Letters on the Masonic Institution By President John Quincy Adams Originally Published: 1847 T. R. Marvin BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS PREFACE IT is now twenty years since there sprung up in the United States an earnest and at times a vehement discussion, of the nature and effect of the bond entered into by those citizens who join the society of Free and Accepted Masons. The excitement which arose in consequence of the disclosures then made, had the effect, at least for a time, if not permanently, to check the farther spread of that association. The legislative power of some of the States was invoked, and at last actually interposed, to prevent the administration of extra-judicial oaths, including of course all such as were constantly taken in the Masonic Order. This was the furthest point which the opposition ever reached. It did not succeed in procuring the dissolution of the organization of the Order, or even the repeal of the charters under which it had a recognized existence in the social system. From the moment of the adoption of a penal law, deemed strong enough to meet the most serious of the evils complained of, the apprehension of further danger from Masonry began to subside. At this day, the subject has ceased to be talked of. The attention of men has been gradually diverted to other things, until at last it may be said, that few persons are aware of the fact, provided it be not especially forced upon their notice, that not only Freemasonry continues to exist, but also that other associations partaking of its secret nature, if not of its unjustifiable obligations, not merely live, but greatly flourish in the midst of them. Fully aware of this state of things, a few private citizens who deeply interested themselves in the investigation of the subject when first agitated, yet feel as if their duty was not entirely performed so long as they shall have left undone any act which in their estimation may have the effect of keeping up among their countrymen a vigilant observation of the nature and tendency of secret associations. Without cherishing the remotest desire, even if they could be supposed to entertain the expectation, of reviving an old excitement, they are nevertheless most anxious to put in a permanently accessible shape, some clear and strong exposition of the evil attending similar ties, as that evil was illustrated years ago in an examination of the Freemason's Oath. Such an exposition they knew could be found in the writings of the Honorable John Quincy Adams. But although the various papers in which it was first issued to the public enjoyed an extensive circulation at the period when it was written, and without doubt contributed much to the establishment of an improved state of popular opinion, they are believed never to have been collected together in any one form readily open to the public examination. This great deficiency, it seemed to the gentlemen who have been already alluded to, a desirable object to supply. They accordingly undertook the task of publishing the present volume, not as a matter of sale, but solely with the intention of gratuitous distribution. And first of all, they deemed",0,0,0,0,0,0

On December 30 of that same year, Ugo Ungaza Villegas, a young Bolivian, damaged the painting by throwing a rock at it.Can anyone perhaps elaborate on this? I mean, the dousing of the painting with acid is reported as though this is a normal thing to be done to a masterpiece and so nothing further needs to be said about it. Did someone just stroll into the Louvre with a beaker of acid and throw it onto the painting?

But as someone who has grown up on the reservations of South Dakota and who pays attention to the world at large I think this is a very biased article.  Everyone is discussing AIM's side and the role of the government in the incident but no one is putting in the view points of the actual residents of South Dakota.  I am not native but many of my friends and family are.  I see AIM in the same way as I assume many people in a variety of countries see their uprising residents on the national news.  The citizens screaming and calling for justice may not be speaking for the population as a whole; but they are the ones that make the news.  I think before you guys make opinions based on what the media tells you; you should find out if the average tribal member agrees with Russel Means or Leonard Peltier.  You should also research how much time they actually spent on the reservation.  Again I am no expert but from what I know growing up here is that AIM and many others like them were extreme liberals that were not necessarily speaking for the society at large.  I just feel that this is similiar as basing views of the Muslim world based on the extremest you see on TV.  I would like to see someone who actually was a neutral member of the Lakota tribe that grew up here to set us all straight and until then to take both sides with a grain of salt.As far as Thunderheart I can say with authority that that movie was a very good example of Hollywoods view of something they know nothing about and not bothering to do any research.

While I don't agree that Katz is as neutral a source as you claim, I'm usually not one to advocate censorship on Wikipedia. However, you could do us a huge favor by trying to make your point (i.e. showing your sourced POV that you want to convey) without endless quotes from one rather biased source. The problem I have is that you are bombarding these articles with an endless tirade of anti-Palestinian quotes that, intentionally or not, turn the article into a hate blog. Again, while I admit I don't agree with your analysis as I think its a distortion of history and a sort of dehumanization, I am NOT asking you to remove it. What I am asking is that you make your point concisely, neutrally, (i.e. provide the point of view in a neutral way, if that makes sense), and in an encyclopedic manner. Endless quotes and tirades like that are not encyclopedic material. There are much better, proper, and neutral ways to make your point. Thanks  (talk) p.s. I noticed a new article Western Wall Tunnel in which you used a Haaretz article by Akiva Eldar as proof that Arafat 'incited' riots. That article says nothing of the sort, and barely mentions the tunnel incident just in passing as 'evidence' that Arafat was trying to get out of a dead end.

"473911d875f73bf6","""Why wikipedia's mod system does not work ;)http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/kevinmaney/2006-09-12-wisdom-of-crowds_x.htm Techies hot on concept of 'wisdom of crowds,' but it has some pitfalls... Posted 9/12/2006 9:40 PM ET Internet types love sweeping ideas that come in the form of book titles that morph into catchphrases that can be dropped like little bombs into conversations to show how smart they are. """"Well, you know, his company was vulnerable to The Innovator's Dilemma, especially because he didn't have a World Is Flat strategy, although he could've seen it coming if he'd tapped into a Wisdom of Crowds approach."""" This is at its most grating when said with a Thurston Howell III accent.  Anyway, the concept of """"the wisdom of crowds"""" — the title of a popular 2004 book by James Surowiecki — is particularly hot among tech companies right now. Yet in the past week, the concept has run into a couple of potholes. One is a rhubarb at Internet darling Digg.com; the other, the U.K. government's case of the hijacked wiki. Both have people wondering if crowds are really all that wise, and what conditions have to exist to make them wise. Why is it that some crowds seem smart, while others turn into ugly mobs? At its most basic level, the wisdom of crowds — let's call it WOC, so I don't have to type as much — means that the aggregated thought and knowledge of thousands or millions of people can be smarter than trained individual experts. The WOC has been around forever — it's what democratic elections try to tap into. But the Net takes it to a whole new level. """"The Internet provides a mechanism to get lots of diverse opinions and aggregate it in a quick and cost-effective way,"""" Surowiecki tells me. So if a company can use the Net to tap the collected intelligence of its employees, the employees will make better decisions than the CEO. IBM, Google and others have tried this. Wikipedia, written and edited by tens of thousands of unpaid contributors, should be better than an encyclopedia written and edited by specialists. News sites such as Digg, which lets users vote stories to the front page, should surface the best stuff more effectively than professional editors. Except it doesn't always work that way. Pointing specifically at Wikipedia, Lauren Weinstein of the People for Internet Responsibility says that the Net has propagated a """"basic fallacy that a wisdom-of-crowds approach could ever work, even theoretically.""""   Which might be extreme. But clearly some of the WOC mechanisms in use today have shortcomings. Take Digg. Founder Kevin Rose set it up with a simple premise: If you like a news item or blog post, you can """"digg"""" it by voting for it. Items with the most votes move to the front of the home page. But cabals of users started working together to boost certain items. Digg became less about the WOC and more about the ambitions of 1,000 or so savvy members. So last week, Rose changed the formula. Digg will use computer programs to try to devalue bloc voting and give more value to what appears to be independent thinking. Digg's regulars revolted, causing a big Web stink. But Surowiecki thinks the site will now be better. """"The thing that makes the wisdom of crowds work is lots of diverse opinions and independent judgments,"""" Surowiecki says. """"Digg acknowledged it wanted more diversity of input."""" So WOC needs the right structure to work, something the U.K.'s Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) found out the hard way. DEFRA decided to let the public help it write environmental contracts, so it posted one on the Net as a wiki. The idea of a wiki — such as Wikipedia — is that anyone can log on and add or change something. In the case of DEFRA's wiki, the public mutilated it. In one of the more printable alterations, someone changed """"Who are the parties to the environmental contract"""" to """"Where is the party for the environmental contract? Can I come? Will there be cake? Hooray!"""" """"These sorts of issues have permeated the Net,"""" Weinstein says. """"Part of the problem is ... it doesn't take a lot of people to cause such disruptions."""" Wikis, as it turns out, are not so much tapping the WOC as they are works in constant progress. Depending on who last wrote something, at any one time the wiki might be good, or bad. Despite hiccups, though, there's still a lot of enthusiasm for WOC. Google, in its own way, is a WOC device. It analyzes links that millions of people put on websites to come up with the most relevant search results. The reputation system on eBay uses WOC to self-police its users. One of the more intriguing WOC site",0,0,0,0,0,0

It flows, its informative, and its not so complicated that you can’t understand. I’d say so far so good.  As for ways to improve on it, I came across a few different points you could consider adding.The main question that kept popping up for me as I read was how do antiandrogens suppress androgen synthesis?  In the Intro is the first time this mechanism is mentioned and again in the Mechanism section itself, however, it seems a little vague and I was left wondering well…if this is a separate mechanism than blocking the receptor, then how exactly are they suppressing synthesis. It makes sense that blocking the receptor would block androgen effects, but wouldn’t androgen levels accumulate if they aren’t binding their receptors as usual? How do the chemicals diminish these levels? These articles may help:http://www.d.umn.edu/~jfitzake/Lectures/DMED/Antineoplastics/Antihormones/AntiAndrogenMechanism.htmlhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptorAlso, how do androgens suppress gonadrotrophin in the case of pharmaceuticals? Is this a similar mechanism? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6427478 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8697573I would be interested in seeing a section on how one can avoid being exposed to these chemicals and to reduce exposure to children during development. Have they found any way to reduce these chemicals in the environment yet?Here’s a neat article on how effects are amplified when exposure is cumulative…might be good to include a little blurb on this.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20487045Is there any current evidence on how release of these chemicals into the environment is  affecting the biodiversity of species and species reproduction? http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr;=&id;=p4CMOZGqD7AC&oi;=fnd&pg;=PA1949&dq;=antiandrogen++biodiversity&ots;=3-c5TjYc5a&sig;=OowBqTRG2i-aJDNShqcs0Sg3OeI#v=onepage&q;&f;=false http://www.intechopen.com/articles/show/title/laboratory-tests-with-androgenic-and-anti-androgenic-pesticides-comparative-studies-on-endocrine-mod http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/3/248.full.pdf http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/2/47/43329773.pdfHope this helps!!",0,0,0,0,0,0

Actually, I can accept trading a 48 hour block for still being allowed to express my feeling towards some of Wikipedia's greatest flaws when it comes to the wiki-police and how it is common for a gang of users to ridicule others without fully studying the facts simply because they do not have the time and/or are enforcing some policy written by the wiki-police. There is a reason newbies are reluctant to become regulars on Wikipedia and most editors that have edited Wikipedia for as long as I have, just basically retire and walk away. What is funny is that during the asteroid re-direct discussions of March and April I was not even around to discuss the consensus that developed. I did not make a single edit to Wikipedia from March 5 to May 1. It will be a great loss to Wikipedia content (vs the wiki-police force and policies) if editors like myself leave because members such as Padenton are allowed to group attack people without bothering to properly look into the facts. Perhaps I should move my near-Earth asteroid work over to a SETI website, but then I would probably have to leave Wikipedia to prevent being further accused of a COI with my edits.

The article is edited and watched closely now. Are the only recent edits those three attempted additions to the Barack Obama article? Hardly a high crime it seems to me.  What you're really upset about is that someone did an unfavorable (but accurate) story about how all attempts to include any mention of controversies or criticisms in the Obama article were reverted. News flash, many of us have had the exact same experience this editor had. If we block users for editing under """"false pretenses"""" so be it, but lots of editors post on other sites about their experiences here. This hardly seems like some grand scheme to bring Wikipedia to its knees.  This check user investigation, however, and the AfD certainly look like an overeaction that only adds fuel to the fire. Klein said he asked someone to make the edits to see what would happen. He reported on the experience and those he witnessed of other attempts to edit the page that are easily viewed through the history.  This hardly seems like something worth making a federal case over. The only mischaracterization is yours: """"under false pretenses to incite a block and, through off-wiki agitation, bring disrepute on the project and trigger a major meltdown on the Obama page."""" The fact is the editor in question arranged for an attempt to make a reasonable edit to grotesquely biased article and reported on the experience.  That it's not favorable to Wikipedia is certainly cause for reflection and consideration of how we can improve our handling of issues like this in the future.

I also had no reason to go to the Air Canada page. But the big difference between the Air Canada article and this article is that this Ryanair article is already messed up. If you were to include this incident the next time something happens they will point to this incident as the reason why the new incident should be included even if minor (example: criticism section) Personally I don't even think that Ryanair flight 296 should be included and it definitely should not have it's own article. For one, there was no fire (which it says in the main article and flight 296 article) only smoke from the release of oil from the broken bearing. Secondly it was the passengers who opened and tried to exit on the wrong side (not sure how that is Ryanair's fault that passengers would exit towards the firefighters) Thirdly, the only problem for Ryanair is that some of the staff had trouble opening the doors but still everybody was able to evacuate in 90 seconds. Then in the flight 296 wiki article they even talk about how paying for uniforms and training in eastern Europe had something to do with the incident even though no ref is provided.

Each of the different nations may have their own """"national anthem"""" and these songs may be officially recognized.14 of the 15 republics of the Soviet Union had their own official song which was used at events connected to that republic. The Russian republic used the USSR's national anthem. Some republics retained the melodies of those songs after the dissolution of the USSR (see the article National anthems of the Soviet Union and Union Republics).The United Kingdom's national anthem is """"God Save the Queen"""" but its constituent countries also have their own anthems which have varying degrees of official recognition. England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each have a number of songs which may be played at occasions such as sports matches and official events. The song usually played for England is """"God Save the Queen"""", though sometimes Jerusalem and Land of Hope and Glory may be played instead. Scotland has relatively recently adopted Flower of Scotland as its unofficial National Anthem, while Wales has sung Mae Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (Land Of My Fathers) since the 19th century. Northern Ireland too has traditionally used """"God Save the Queen"""" though Londonderry Air is also used.""""Wales has sung Mae Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (Land Of My Fathers) since the 19th century"""", which is pretty good going - was it non-stop?

Here is what it says, as of today: Ethnic Ruthenians were frequently a rural people and often formed minorities in their own cities and towns. For example, Kiev in the 1920s was approximately 1/3 Jewish and 1/3 Russian, with the remaining third constituting ethnic Ukrainians, Poles, and Germans. A similar demographic history existed in Lviv with a majority Polish and Jewish population.Am I the only Ukrainian editor who finds these kind of statements offensive? Not only these kinds of claims have absolutely no ground in the known Ukrainian historical facts, but they, in fact, repeat, almost word in word, the statements made by anti-Western anti-Ukrainian Putin propaganda!I asked the editors to provide the citations justifying the obviously false claims in these paragraphs.

I generally use a combination of Illustrator CS and a text editor, and any knowledge on basic SVG specifications for basic types (such as default parameter values, so that certain data can be excluded). I used to use Inkscape, but it felt too clunky and produces really bloated SVG code—it is sad to say (since I support free software) that I really appreciate Illustrator, since it is slick and produces very clean SVG code. Certainly, Adobe authored the SVG specifications, so it is not surprising that Illustrator writes the best output (in my opinion). However, when opening SVG files in Illustrator that were originally saved in the Inscape SVG format, Illustrator will usually retain the """"sodipodi"""" metadata, which is specific only to that application (and Inkscape). I try to remove the sodipodi data using a text editor to keep the code to the standard SVG coding, then reopen/save in Illustrator. Another method is to save the figure as an Illustrator AI or PDF file, then reopen/save in Illustrator again to shed the sodipodi metadata.

There was general anger that there had been people dying of the disease for so long and no one outside the gay community seemed to care.  There was definite anger toward the Reagan administration, the Moral Majority and what was seen as the self-righteous extreme right.  But actual """"resentment"""" from PWA's in the gay community toward a child dying of the disease many they knew were dying of?  Not.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0
