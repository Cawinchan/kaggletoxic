"18a52232f822dbac","""Can you please try to see the glass being half full instead of half empty.  I'm certainly not trying to do anything that you or others would see as """"problematic"""".  Five weeks ago I was getting involved in wikipedia and I was feeling enthusiastic, so I posted something to some user groups (reaching 10,000+ members), encouraging them to contribute to wikipedia.  I thought, at the time, that long-time wikipedia people would be more welcoming of new people, and that wikipedians would be happy that I encouraged others to participate.  I was not trying to target and encourage employees of a commercial product to contribute.  The groups I posted to were user groups, not employee groups.  But yes, I guess that some employees belong to these groups as well.  And my comment about Hill using the talk page was simply to comment that my personal POV is that he found a good way for someone with COI to contribute. I feel that the negative and accusing tone of your last sentence is unwarranted. It is un-welcoming comments like that that drive away new wikipedia contributors.  I see my wikipedia contributions as a way of giving unselfishly to the world, trying to spread knowledge and improve understanding.  I think that even if I only have time to make a small number of contributions, I feel I am helping, and that this should be the spirit of wikipedia.  So seeing your criticism that I am not making enough edits to non-commercial products is just frustrating and disheartening to me.I hate feeling that I have to defend my reputation here, and I don't agree with you that editing non-commercial pages should improve anyone's appearance of trustworthiness.  However, your claim that I am only editing the wikipedia entries of """"these commercial products"""" is also just incorrect.  I don't know if there is a way to view the wikipedia contributions of others, but if there is, you would see that I've been making edits to many non-commercial pages, including CRISP-DM, Data mining, the journal Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, Predictive analytics, Statistics, Customer retention, Predictive Model Markup Language, Anomaly detection, SEMMA, Machine learning, Jacques Cousteau, SIGKDD, Decision tree learning.  Sometimes I'm making simple formatting edits, and sometimes I'm spending hours trying to track down the right references to put on the CRISP-DM page.  Yes, my edits are mostly in the general area of data mining, because that is where I have the greatest interest and knowledge.  Similarly, when I guest lecture at local universities, I lecture to these types of classes, not due to any collusion, but because that's what I know.Thanks for listening to my mini-rant.  I know I'm taking this more personally than you probably meant it.  But it bothers me when someone questions that I am not working hard enough or they question my ethics, and that's what your comments feel like.  All I'm asking is that long-established wikipedia people be more welcoming and encouraging, and give new people the benefit of the doubt that they are acting in good faith trying to make meaningful contributions (however small).  New people grow and adjust - but it takes a while to learn the conventions of the wikipedia community.  Please be patient and encouraging to new people.I'm going to leave this discussion now.  If needed, I will return to it after the holiday season.  But I hope there is no need to.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

"cf7ab8e72c1070f1","Firstly, Montanabw, there is no such thing as Equus caballus. That is a domesticated animal. The proper name is Equus ferus caballus - unless domesticated Horses somehow come from Zebras or Asses... Also, there is no consensus that Equus ferus ever set foot on the North American continent, though I personally believe Equus lambei may be a subspecy of Equus ferus. Thirdly, and most importantly, and I hope EVERYONE is listening here when I say this, Equus ferus caballus, the domesticated Horse IS NO MORE native to the North American west than Chihuahuas are to the Canadian tundra. Domestic forms are native NOWHERE. Period. The domestic Horse is RADICALLY different from it's wild ancestor. And Dysmorodrepanis, the reason all the Equine articles are so Horse-centric is because a very large number of vociferous (and outright foolish) people are unhealthily obsessed with horses. Unfortunately, many of these people also think themselves expert enough to declare a domestic animal native to a continent it never inhabited simply because they like to watch them run. Seriously, that's all it is. They like looking at them. It's certainly not an environmental issue. Horses are wildly destructive to their surroundings. They eat more than cattle! And an obscene amount more than the native Pronghorn (which, by the way doesn't trample its food to death like the Mustangs do with they're enormous, heavy-stepping hooves). The only argument the Mustang and Burro worshippers have to use (and they milk it good, let me tell ya) is the similarity of Equus lambei to Equus ferus. But, Equus lambei has not been proven to be synonymous with Equus ferus (though it is a possibility), and even if it were it would be more closely related, by far, to Przewalski's Horse than to Mustangs! E. lambei was tiny! It was like four feet tall at the shoulders! And all the other North American Equids are pretty well-known to not be synonyms with Equus ferus (including E. caballus). Not by a long shot. This is why the Horse Evolution page (and every other page dealing with equines) has been changed back and forth so many times. The people who know what the heck they're talking about try to add useful information and correct blatant lies or grievous mistakes and the people who like pretty ponies go back and try to convince the world that Spanish horses have roamed every continent including Antarctica, Mars and the Sun since before Dinosaurs walked on two feet. I made the ridiculous mistake of trying to add factual information to the Mustang article and, if I remember correctly, it was changed WITHIN THE HOUR. The person doing the changing even removed the scientific names I inserted! The Mustang article has absolutely no indication of what specy the Mustang belongs to now! I swear this endless struggle between the My Little Ponyites and REAL BIOLOGISTS is like the Evolution vs. creationism argument, only dumber. Like I said, these people aren't calling for us to turn our rotweillers loose into the nearest forest, but why not? I mean, it's the same specy as the Gray Wolf. Domestication doesn't matter, if you listen to these people. If that's the case then why aren't we restocking mature Oak forests with farm raised white turkeys? I mean, it's the same specy, after all. Oh. And this is my favourite. Where Wild Asses are actually native they're critically endangered. But I have not read ONE WORD from the Cult of the Mustang and Burro about saving them from ACTUAL extinction, but get this, they want to have the Mustangs and Burros in America declared endangered species.

In fact, if this difficult constitutional question had to be addressed, FISA would be unconstitutional as applied to this narrow context.

The first paragraph includes useful and clear overview of the topic, however, it could use a little more information that would broaden the interests of readers. They key points in this article are based on historical occurrences that have contributed to rapid changing events in the workforce and that also created a standard for change management in a way. The information includes sufficient information regarding the history and the context of this topic. It most definitely covers a variety of topics, including the reasons for such change. In addition to that, the article addresses the key issues including globalization and technology that have heavily influenced change management. There is therefore well supported evidence throughout the article and the analysis of certain models proves that the article is referenced and can be proven with contextual information. The article itself has a clear focus on a topic and also includes detailed scholarly support throughout the text, which can be found in the reference section. The contribution considers a variety of perspectives, however, I think it primarily focuses on today’s rapidly changing world, in reference towards globalization and technology and maybe could focus more than just a few scholars. It takes an appropriate tone in providing points of view in the context of globalization and technology and is supported with appropriate references throughout the page. I think for this article there are sufficient references but more references can always be beneficial and offer more content. The article represents a neutral point of view but in a way is sort of drawn towards today’s issues in terms of globalization and technology and offers a certain point of view. It does a good job staying with the facts and avoiding opinions. In terms of article length, the only thing I would suggest is a longer intro with a little more information for the reader to have. Overall, it’s a well written entry with detailed information about change management.

"e1eb9692d0549882","""=Sexism in MGS5, relevant to an encyclopedic entry on the game?===Came back to this article to see if any progress had been made on cleaning it up. Good to see some progress has been made.I'm going to make a few points here and well.. hopefully people will be rationale and objective about it.Misinformation. This article is rife with it. It's incredibly important for an encyclopedia to present accurate information. An encyclopedia should not be an opinion column, it should not overly represent any opinion since they are not based on fact, nor relevant to a topic. I'm going to start with the 'Sexualized Portrayal of Quiet' and sadly I'm going to have to tear it apart. Please put how you feel about it or any emotion you may have about the topic aside when you read the following points;1 - No other character in any other Metal Gear title pages is given this amount of scrutiny. Quiet has been highlighted by the media as sexist, this is true. However this is not a reason for an encyclopedic entry to focus on a given character. The page is not a study of the media's (or anyone else's) reaction to Quiet as a character. There should be balance in the reception section, giving a whole section to Quiet versus no other characters is not balanced.2 - Misinformation. """"Michael McWhertor criticized Quiet's portrayal, pointing out that while the game explains that her nakedness derives from a photosynthetic skin condition, several other characters with the same condition — such as Code Talker in The Phantom Pain and The End in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater — appear fully clothed.""""Regardless of the source of information, if it is incorrect information it should not be in the entry. Quiet is naked because her lungs were burnt to a crisp, the game specifically mentions this and other fans have mentioned it on the page I believe. Code Talker and The End have the same ability correct, but they did not get set on fire and thrown out of a building. I'm really baffled this is in here because McWhertor is not an authority on this whatsoever. Kojima and the game writers are. Source it correctly or remove the information I would have said.3 - Opinion columns. This baffles me. Why are opinion pieces been taken as reception? They are not professional video game reviewers. By the media's own admission they are just someone writing their opinion about something, it's not objective. They wouldn't even claim to be unbiased as it's an opinion. You are introducing bias here by taking an opinion and presenting it for no reason other than to say """"this person didn't like Quiet's portrayal"""". If tomorrow Donald Trump wrote an opinion piece on Quiet for a media outlet, is that relevant to an encyclopedic entry about something?4 - Further irrelevant information. There are sources and information here that talk about the PlayArtsKai figurine of Quiet. Are you out of your mind?! What relevance does this have to the RECEPTION OF THE GAME??? The video game this entry is about. To start with PlayArtsKai is a completely separate company that we have no idea or information about how much Hideo Kojima was involved with. One would assume since they are completely different companies ENTIRELY that Konami simply licensed the intellectual property rights of Quiet to PlayArtsKai. It goes without saying but Twitter is not a valid source of information.5 - Dates. Numerous sources are reactions to the character Quiet and precede the date of release. Thus they are not a reception of the game itself. Hence why are they in a section called """"Reception"""" to start with.5 - Forbes contributors and Anita Sarkeesian. We seem to have established that Forbes contributors are not valid sources so I expect this will be okay to remove.Everything else seems to be sourced from valid sources who are professional video game reviewers. Although again I'd suggest that Quiet is getting an amazing amount of spotlight in the article for no other reason than controversy To any senior editors, administrators, or anyone with an interest in Wikipedia standards. It should be extremely concerning that this level of bias is present in an article that is supposed to be by and large, factual. 86.40.28.221  ==""",0,0,0,0,0,0

"092c04fa0489aa72","Deletion of AV News page Just curious why the AV News page is being deleted while its primary competitor Antelope Valley Press is allowed to have its page here unmolested.Granted we have only been in business for six years but we are every bit as a legitimate news organization as AV Press and even more so than AV Town Crier, whose page is also allowed to be here I note.Here is the content:The AV News began as a weekly print newspaper with emphasis on local news located in Lancaster, California USA. It was the second largest circulating newspaper in the area after it began publishing in 2006. In 2008, the AV News added a website and in March 2010, much like the Seatte Post-Intelligencer, the AV News transitioned to a web-only publication. The AV News covers the Antelope Valley area of Los Angeles County - mainly the Palmdale/Lancaster Urbanized Area (a US Census Bureau defined term) and areas of north Los Angeles and southeastern Kern counties, including Acton, Agua Dulce, Edwards AFB, Lake Los Angeles, Mojave, Quartz Hill, Rosamond and Santa Clarita. The newspaper is conservative in its political stance. It is currently the official news publication of the Lancaster JetHawks, a minor league baseball team in Lancaster.HistoryThe AV News was founded by Fran Paolinelli in 2006. She continues to work at the publication today. It began as a weekly print publication before dropping its print version to become a web only publication at www.avnewsday.comThe paper, conservative leaning, holds strongly held views, which can become controversial at times.Competitors in its market are the Daily News, Antelope Valley Press and the Los Angeles Times.External linksAV News Official WebsiteThe format is the same as the AV Press. There is less historical info that the AV Press because we have only been going for six years and they've been up for decades. But still, we are getting e-mails from people who use Wiki to find out about the Lancaster/Palmdale area and are surprised to find out that there are more newspapers in the area than what they find listed.I also point out that the City of Lancaster is a major advertiser with us as is the local professional baseball team.Please info me as to what more I need to include so that our page will be left on site or restore the page.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Some with a strong FYROM POV around here argue that 'Republic of Macedonia' is the only official name in use and wish to lock it in at Wikipedia.While true many nations and NGO's have chosen in the interim to use """"Republic of Macedonia""""... all nations in principle agree to honour whatever name FYROM/Greece can hammer out. When it comes to Wikipedia itself all names should be used if NPOV was actually being observed... especially since the dispute is still ongoing.  Many countries around the world still officially use FYROM (including even the US which still uses both names at times (the US Senate resolution last year condemning FYROM actually used the FYROM name).What I really think is missing from the article is that technically speaking FYROM is currently in breach of at least a few of its original UN brokered terms with Greece. (This incidentally is exactly why I the why the US government passed the resolution last year condemning FYROM for breaking terms,  why the Greek government vetoed FYROM's  recent attempt at NATO membership, , and why it will probably veto EU membership as well.)Agreement Violation #1: FYROM was supposed to stick to FYROM for external useFYROM citizens are now trying to be recognized exclusively as """"Republic of Macedonia"""" even though in Article 7 of the original UN brokered agreement (which their own leaders signed) specifically states""""the Party of the First Part reserves the right to object to any membership referred to above if and to the extent of the Party of the Second Part is to be referred to in such organization or institution differently than in paragraph 2 of the United Nations Security Council resolution 817 (1993). (which is still be FYROM I believe)Agreement Violation #2:: Refrain from propaganda against Greek cultural heritage and territoryArticle 7 and 11 of the UN agreement between Greece and FYROM state:.""""Each Party shall promptly take effective measures to prohibit hostile activities or propaganda by State-controlled agencies and to discourage acts by private entities likely to incite violence, hatred or hostility against each other.If either Party believes one or more symbols constituting part of its historic or cultural patrimony is being used by the other Party, it shall bring such alleged use to the attention of the other Party, and the other Party shall take appropriate corrective action or indicate why it does not consider it necessary to do so.The article should probably include a few real world examples to show the complaints are very real. I myself recently heard someone from FYROM claim Aristotle was actually Slavic on a forum but there are literally thousands of examples of irredentist behavior to be found. (a small subset of some recent examples that seemed relevant, verifiable and seemingly demonstrate the argument beyond the abstract) There exists a steady stream of FYROM supporters on the Alexander_the_Great article history page claiming Alexander wasn't Greek.  Top ranked FYROM websites  almost universally are writing revisionist histories that suggest Alexander was not Greek  (quote taken from the website)""""Contrary to modern Greek claims, Macedonia was never part of Greece, and the ancient Macedonians were not regarded as ancient Greeks.""""Current FYROM Prime Minister welcomes Pakistan “Macedonian” Prince Ghazanfar  and uses it as """"proof"""" of their ancient Macedonian roots.

To answer your question, yes, I am the one who left a nasty message on a user's page whose name now escapes me.  Why did I do it?  He took off the picture of Bobby Abreu that I took, looks like he tried to replace it with a copyrighted photo, and the Abreu article went for a few weeks without an image.  Now I don't mean this as anything personal against you, as I've respected you and your work for years, and you've been nothing but nice to me.  But, what I don't get is this: I can't tell you how many times I've had to re-introduce legititmate images that have been taken down by people who upload stolen images, or images of lesser quality.  This detracts from the quality of articles, and frankly, I think people who detract from the quality of articles should'nt be allowed to edit.  What I don't get is that whenever I pop-off at someone for doing this, I get busted immediately, yet no one replaced the Abreu image, or scores of others that are taken down.  Furthermore, the guy who did this is just another red link - someone who doesn't even bother to fill out a user page.  It's all a matter of common sense and etiquette - it's not the best analogy, but you just don't go to MySpace or Facebook and start putting useless garbage on other people's pages.  Same goes for Wikipedia - you just don't go around making articles worse, that legitmate volunteers have worked for years to constantly improve.  So, I take it upon myself to discourage users who don't add to the site.  And yes, I've been blocked permanently from editing Wikipedia, but look what happened to the guy who was the ultimate reason for my block.  If I'm a jerk, I'm a jerk towards people who deserve it, and these two most abundantly deserved it.  Anyway, sorry this is so long winded.
